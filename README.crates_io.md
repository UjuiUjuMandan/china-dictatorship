## About (关于)

This repo has the following goals:

* allow copy pasting links to answers to questions/comments that have been posted a million times before by [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)), mostly under: [FAQ (常见问答集)](#faq-(常见问答集)). This was the original goal.
* serve as a censorship bomb to block [GitHub](#github) in China: [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)) to destroy the [Great Firewall (GFW, 防火长城)](#great-firewall-(gfw,-防火长城)) and [therefore the CCP](#would-ending-the-great-firewall-truly-end-the-dictatorship?-(结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)). Or more realistically get added to the [GitHub gov-takedowns (由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的GitHub官方列表)](#github-gov-takedowns-(由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的github官方列表)) hall of fame.
* be a fun and sometimes silly source of Chinese mostly anti-CCP culture like a better [Unencyclopedia](https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/China) / [Encyclopedia Dramatica](https://web.archive.org/web/20191209021646/http://encyclopediadramatica.rs/China) without the stupid stereotype jokes. Just quickly browse the pictures with Ctrl + F "Figure" and have fun.
* serve as a place where people can post interesting related stuff in the issues: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues see also: [I want to take my chances and make a shitpost in cirosantilli/china-dictatorship (屎帖子)](#i-want-to-take-my-chances-and-make-a-shitpost-in-cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-(屎帖子))
* highlight positive about China’s culture outside of its shitty government, such as [food](#the-best-chinese-supermarket-food-products-(中国超市食物)) and [Chinese Music (中国音乐)](#chinese-music-(中国音乐)). This has two goals:
  * teach foreigners (maybe even Chinese people on certain points) about amazing Chinese things that they can consume
  * show wumaos that [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) is not as clueless about China as they think

## Copypasta

Here’s an image/sentence [copypasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copypasta)/summary of key events for the [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)).

Another advantage of this is that since it comes first in the repo, it ensures that key elements show up on github.com despite file size cutups: [https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610).

Each summary section contains a link to the main section, which contains sources and description of each image.

## Mirrors of this page (此网页的镜像)

You can download the webpage locally from GitHub at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/archive/gh-pages.zip

Media such as images are not stored in this repository, but rather at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media to keep the lightweight clone. That downloaded HTML will read images from that repository, e.g. [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg). But we’ve learnt after creating that maybe the raw.githubusercontent.com subdomain is censored: [GitHub censored subdomains (GitHub 审查的子域)](#github-censored-subdomains-(github-审查的子域)). If anyone can confirm, we will start using another image provider by default.

Clone locally with Git using GitHub images:

```
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
cd china-dictatorship
git checkout gh-pages
xdg-open README.html
```

Build it yourself:

```
bundle install
make
xdg-open README.html
```

Build and view the multipage version:

```
make multipage
xdg-open out/multipage/README.html
```

Build with GitLab served images:

```
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
cd china-dictatorship
make MEDIA=MEDIA=https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/-/raw/master
```

Build with local images:

```
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media
cd china-dictatorship
make MEDIA=../china-dictatorship-media
```

or build to use GitLab images:

Given [GitHub censored subdomains (GitHub 审查的子域)](#github-censored-subdomains-(github-审查的子域)), this might be the only way to view the images from China.

The cool thing about Git is that we can maintain several mirrors on multiple websites very easily:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship Canonical source and rendered output. If ever [GitHub gov-takedowns (由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的GitHub官方列表)](#github-gov-takedowns-(由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的github官方列表)) we do this: [Strategy if this repo gets added to GitHub gov-takedowns (如果此 repo 被添加到 GitHub gov-takedowns 中的策略)](#strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns-(如果此-repo-被添加到-github-gov-takedowns-中的策略))
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-2 mirror in case they block just [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship), see also: [Strategy if this repo gets added to GitHub gov-takedowns (如果此 repo 被添加到 GitHub gov-takedowns 中的策略)](#strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns-(如果此-repo-被添加到-github-gov-takedowns-中的策略)). Active renaming in place due to [Chinese web browser censorship (中国网页浏览器审查)](#chinese-web-browser-censorship-(中国网页浏览器审查))
* [https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli](https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli): a mirror just so that some interesting stuff will show up at [https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli](https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli). The policy is to transfer any [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) issues from there to [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship). Interestingly, https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli/issues/53 from that project because the second yandex.com hit for "六四事件" as of 2022/04/17, and the only one that is not yet censored in China entirely, which drives reasonable traffic (3500 hist / 2 weeks).
* https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
  * their gitlab.com render is shit for some reason, clicking on the ToC does not jump to headers properly, not sure why, IDs look correct
  * one really cool thing about gitlab is that it can serve images from directly gitlab.com e.g. https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/-/raw/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg unlike GitHub which has the `raw.` subdomain: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xi_Jinping_The_Governance_of_China_photo.jpg This makes it impossible to block the GitLab images without blocking all of gitlab.com, until GitLab starts a [gov-takedowns](#github-gov-takedowns-(由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的github官方列表)) of their own.
  * https://cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship GitLab Pages. Works fine. Let’s see if they can block subdomains: https://zh.greatfire.org/https/cirosantilli.gitlab.io/china-dictatorship
  * Maybe some day https://gitlab.cn/ ? :-) Edit 2021-03, yup, it happened, with [ICP license 非经营性网站备案 (2000)](#icp-license-非经营性网站备案-(2000)) and all
    * https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/18/gitlab-licensed-technology-to-new-independent-chinese-company/

    * no free public SaaS yet, but it might come, though they are saying 30 day trial only: https://about.gitlab.cn/free-trial/
* https://gitee.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship on [Gitee](#gitee), blocked after 12 hours: [Gitee censorship (Gitee 审查)](#gitee-censorship-(gitee-审查))
* https://bitbucket.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship
* [https://gitlab.binets.fr/ciro.duran-santilli/china-dictatorship](https://gitlab.binets.fr/ciro.duran-santilli/china-dictatorship): a GitLab instance run by and reserved for students and ex-students of [École Polytechnique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_Polytechnique), in which Ciro Santilli previously studied. They also have a few Chinese students every year, that’s how Ciro met [Ciro Santilli's wife (三西猴的老婆)](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)), it will be fun when those students see this.

Mirrors controlled by other people, thus forming a type of [Samizdat (Soviet underground propagation of censored materials, 秘密出版物, самиздат)](#samizdat-(soviet-underground-propagation-of-censored-materials,-秘密出版物,-самиздат)):

* https://git.kiwifarms.net/CrunkLord420/china-dictatorship auto-pull Gitea mirror on [Kiwi Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms), a [politically incorrect](#censorship-of-"politically-incorrect-speech"-(审查政治不正确言论)) social network website
* [https://github.com/cheezcharmer/chinese-dictatorship](https://github.com/cheezcharmer/chinese-dictatorship): Ciro likes that this due actually changed the repository title, thus making it harder to auto-censor everything in one go
* https://china.fptbb.com

Ones that went down:

They’re also hosting a search engine proxy at [https://www.vkoor.com/](https://www.vkoor.com/), TODO Google? See also: [Google mirrors (谷歌镜像)](#google-mirrors-(谷歌镜像)). Down 2022-08.

GitHub Pages: https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship trade-offs with [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship):

* pros
  * cut up to 512KB of source, and therefor unacceptable as the only source: [https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610](https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/1610)
  * [GitHub’s camo](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/about-anonymized-image-urls) keeps hiccuping and not showing images
  * and YouTube videos show inline there
* cons
  * domain will eventually get blocked in China. [GreatFire (自由微博)](#greatfire-(自由微博)) https://zh.greatfire.org/https/cirosantilli.com shows that in 2020-01-19 the domain was unblocked, but on the next text at 2020-05-23 it was "contradictory".
  * Camo bypasses the need for VPN, since most images are served from [Wayback Machine (web.archive.org, 网站时光机)](#wayback-machine-(web.archive.org,-网站时光机)) which is [blocked in China](#censorship-(审查)).

It is really interesting to see how many people star the GitHub repository, and then a few minutes later they think about how they might get put in jail, and then unstar it. Talk about [Chilling effect (寒蝉效应)](#chilling-effect-(寒蝉效应))! But yes, for the love of God, please stay safe: [What should pro-democracy Chinese living in China do about the dictatorship? 想要民主住在中国大陆的人应该干什么？](#what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship?-想要民主住在中国大陆的人应该干什么？).

GitHub Pages was first enabled in 2020-03-22 at [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/commit/0b362a83fb5dd55f67b9d351551d0c18e7f3229a](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/commit/0b362a83fb5dd55f67b9d351551d0c18e7f3229a).

The perfect solution might be to download all images and upload them to https://github.com/cirosantilli/media since GitHub content does not go through Camo, we have to see if such images don’t fail to load as often.

A few NPM/Git CDNs can also be used to bypass subdomain blocks, and some actually render HTML with the correct content type. Lists of such CDNs:

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8446218/how-to-see-an-html-page-on-github-as-a-normal-rendered-html-page-to-see-preview

### Software package mirrors (软件包管理器镜像)

We also have a NPM Node.js package [https://www.npmjs.com/package/china-dictatorship](https://www.npmjs.com/package/china-dictatorship). After [installing NPM](https://askubuntu.com/questions/594656/how-to-install-the-latest-versions-of-nodejs-and-npm/971612#971612), you can be use it as:

```
npm i -g china-dictatorship
china-dictatorship > README.html
```

This forces China to also block/curate package managers to block this repo. The package is already available in the following NPM Chinese mirrors, both which were blocked at some point:

* Taobao: https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200406081433/http://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship)).

  Noticed down as of 2021-02-23, replaced by a dummy package admined by fengmk2@gmail.com presumably https://github.com/fengmk2 and https://fengmk2.com/ and https://twitter.com/fengmk2 He is a large NPM contributor, and likely `cnpm` too. TODO is he pro or against [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)) based on online comments?

  In order to overcome this, includers
* Aliyun from [Alibaba (阿里巴巴, Chinese Amazon clone)](#alibaba-(阿里巴巴,-chinese-amazon-clone)): https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/china-dictatorship ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210211123658/https://developer.aliyun.com/mirror/npm/package/china-dictatorship)).

  Taken down as 404 likely around 2021-02-22 after come incoming links from [https://developer.aliyun.com](https://developer.aliyun.com) to [https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship?spm=a2c6h.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4vwIZTP](https://cirosantilli.com/china-dictatorship?spm=a2c6h.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4vwIZTP) and `?spm=.14275010.0.0.60be9dc4PsRmA`.

There is actually a `cnpm` tool to install from Chinese mirrors: [https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

We also managed to upload a Python PyPi package at: https://pypi.org/project/china-dictatorship/ Is as:

```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade china-dictatorship
china-dictatorship.py > README.html
```

This package was deleted by pypi in 2023 without any warning or notification:

* https://web.archive.org/web/20230306090740/https://pypi.org/project/china-dictatorship/ up March 2023
* http://web.archive.org/web/20231110041847/https://pypi.org/project/china-dictatorship/ November 2023

and re-attempting upload fails with:

```
ERROR    HTTPError: 400 Bad Request from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
         The name 'china-dictatorship' isn't allowed. See https://pypi.org/help/#project-name for more information.
```

Bastanrds and Cowards.

Like NPM, this will also have Chinese mirrors that will need to be censored by their admins ovrview https://titanwolf.org/Network/Articles/Article?AID=25a20c20-c97b-4bfe-af67-760861343658 :

* http://pypi.douban.com/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs http://pypi.douban.com/simple/numpy both up March 2021
* http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs http://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/numpy both down March 2021 but in a different way, so maybe it was censored already
* http://pypi.mirrors.opencas.cn/simple/china-dictatorship vs http://pypi.mirrors.opencas.cn/simple/numpy both down March 2021
* http://pypi.v2ex.com/simple/china-dictatorship vs http://pypi.v2ex.com/simple/numpy both down March 2021
* https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/china-dictatorship vs https://pypi.mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/simple/numpy both up March 2021
* reference: https://pypi.org/simple/china-dictatorship/ vs https://pypi.org/simple/numpy/

We later found on Google by chance that libraries.io picked it up and rendered the README.adoc nicely as well: https://libraries.io/pypi/china-dictatorship ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200318043050/https://libraries.io/pypi/china-dictatorship)). This is why packaging is a good idea.

A programmatic interface is also exposed on those packages, making it easy to quickly add a `--china` option to your project, e.g. from Python:

```
import china_dictatorship
assert "Tiananmen Square protests" in china_dictatorship.get_data()

print(china_dictatorship.get_data())
```

or from Node.js:

```
const china_dictatorship = require('china-dictatorship');
if (!china_dictatorship.get_data().includes("Tiannmen Square protests")) throw 0;

console.log(china_dictatorship.get_data());
```

You have to do the assert after the imports because otherwise Chinese mirrors could replace the real package with dummy packages to not break imports, as was already done once at [https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship](https://registry.npm.taobao.org/china-dictatorship).

This outputs the rendered HTML, which end users should the pipe into a file:

```
./your-program --china > README.html
xdg-open README.html
```

Concrete examples:

* https://cirosantilli.com/cirodown/china
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/linux-kernel-module-cheat/commit/082166a360c56990662c715196229016d8806ab3
* [https://github.com/cirosantilli/vcdvcd#vcdcat-china](https://github.com/cirosantilli/vcdvcd#vcdcat-china). Sample forks removing the most important functionality:
  * https://github.com/ZihaoZhao/vcdvcd
  * https://github.com/riverlane/vcdvcd/commits/master by employee [Seyed Amir Alavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seyed-amir-alavi/) of quantum computing company https://www.riverlane.com/ with commit "Removed politics from package dependencies of setup.py". Seyed appears to be [Iranian](#iran-(伊朗)).
  * https://github.com/snhobbs/vcdvcd/commit/d7124e49fb1c63002e830f8c866266447b0f5bb3 by [https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonnhobbs/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonnhobbs/). To be fair, they left a star.

These also offer great plausible deniability: a citizen in China could always argue that they were just interested in the software itself, and had no choice but to download it.

TODO: create an Ubuntu PPA and Ruby gem as well.

Create tags,and update all mirrors in one go with: [push-mirrors](push-mirrors):

```
sudo apt install python3-setuptools
python3 -m pip install --user setuptools wheel twine
./push-mirrors
```

In particular, that script calls [push](push):

```
./push
```

which is more lightweight and pushes just to GitHub and GitLab Pages, so we are going to be using that more often to avoid overloading package managers too much.

`./push` is used to publish every commit.

There is no need to update package versions or add git tags, all of that gets done automatically by the script!

#### GitHub proxies (GitHub的代理)

Another source of China-specific mirroring of this project are GitHub proxies, https://linuxpip.org/github-in-china/ contains an overview:

* https://hub.fgit.ml/ this one is quite professional, offering paid access plans for better performance as seen at https://fgit.ml
* https://hub.fastgit.org/ this appears to auto-redirect to GitHub from non-Chinese IPs, but presumably shows the pages for Chinese IPs, e.g. we had hits from [http://hub.fastgit.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship](http://hub.fastgit.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship) in 2021-03-25. This happened soon after SEO optimizations mentioned at: [Zhao Heming (召赫名)](#zhao-heming-(召赫名)) and might be related.

  At https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/945 for some incomprehensible reason, user https://github.com/StarOnTheSky claiming to be from the fastgit team asked mentions of fastgit to be removed from this repository, menacing to report to [How to report a user on GitHub (GitHub上怎么举报用户？)](#how-to-report-a-user-on-github-(github上怎么举报用户？)) otherwise.
* https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/ as of March 2021, it often reaches an apparently random "Whoa there! You have triggered an abuse detection mechanism.". But other time it succeeds, e.g. some of the times: https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship is visible.
* https://a1.mk-proxy.ml/-----https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship generated from http://toolwa.com/github/
* https://github.com/521xueweihan/GitHub520
* https://github-dotcom.gateway.web.tr/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship a Turkish proxy. They have their own censorship issues as well of course.
* https://phoenix.yizimg.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship Not sure origin, https://web.archive.org/web/20200221135123/http://www.yizimg.com:80/ has a little bit of information

Jekyll GitHub Pages repository that saves full text copies of censored articles:

> 本仓库存放被删文章
>
> This repository stores deleted articles.

Also accompanies a dynamic forum https://2049bbs.xyz/ which appears to be where content for the static pages gets discussed and brought up. But it possible that the website has been compromised and is leaking identity of users. At some point, https://2049bbs.xyz went down. Live https://web.archive.org/web/20200719151022/https://2049bbs.xyz/ dead: https://archive.vn/JFqCJ

The "Terminus" in the repo name seems to be a reference to Isaac Asimov’s fictional [Terminus planet](https://asimov.fandom.com/wiki/Terminus) which is called [端点星](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/端点星) in Chinese, but it is not clear where the 2049 comes from in that context. Forgetting the Chinese name, Terminus2049 could be a reference to the fictional ["World War Terminus"](https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_Terminus) from the [Blade Runner 2049 (2019)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049) movie, which also explains the 2049.

First commit on 2018-04-27, GitHub pages domain blocked in China at least since 2019-03 according to [GreatFire (自由微博)](#greatfire-(自由微博)): https://zh.greatfire.org/search/all/https%3A//terminus2049.github.io but not in [GitHub gov-takedowns (由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的GitHub官方列表)](#github-gov-takedowns-(由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的github官方列表)) as of 2020-04.

The full post list can be seen most conveniently at: https://github.com/Terminus2049/Terminus2049.github.io/tree/master/_posts The number of articles is insane, usually several every day.

Most articles appear to be taken from recent news at the time of writting, although there are a few from before the repo started. As of 2020-04, the oldest article was from 2016 [MeToo](#metoo) events reported by [Yue Xin (岳昕)](#yue-xin-(岳昕)), some other topics include:

### duty-machine GitHub account (责任机器GitHub用户)

https://github.com/duty-machine

Anonymous user with automation setup such that anyone can request certain webpages to be copied on to GitHub anonymously through a separate website, notably:

* [https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine](https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine): big Chinese social media, e.g. [Weibo (新浪微博)](#weibo-(新浪微博)), [Zhihu (知乎, censored Quora clone, 审查 Quora 克隆)](#zhihu-(知乎,-censored-quora-clone,-审查-quora-克隆)), Douban. Articles stored in issues. Archive requests: https://archives.duty-machine.now.sh/
* [https://github.com/duty-machine/news](https://github.com/duty-machine/news): big Western news websites like Reuters, BBC, etc. Articles stored in-tree.

The project claims to have been inspired by [Terminus2049 (端点星计划, 2049bbs)](#terminus2049-(端点星计划,-2049bbs)), but hopefully they will have better operational security.

Unfortunately, it was found that the project could be used by malicious users to at mention spam GitHub users: [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/192](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/192), let’s see if they patch it. Edit: the did.

#### duty-machine porn attack (责任机器色情攻击)

https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine/tree/d6ee9ff8e504b863352f163f7e143e84161ac349 explains that the automatic submission had to be taken down because [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) uploaded porn which is against GitHub’s content policy.

Related idiotic attempt on [China Dictatorship (中国独裁统治)](#china-dictatorship-(中国独裁统治)) project: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/500 where user crazy3523 uploaded some of Ciro’s own existing anti-China images, and tried to pretend to be anti-CCP, and slipped a few child porn softcore in the middle hoping Ciro wouldn’t see them. Their email was &lt;crazy3523@protonmail.com>. They even went as far as creating another apparently anti-CCP post at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/386 previously.

This likely led the repository to be added to [GitHub "This repository may contain objectionable content" (此仓库可能包含令人反感的内容)](#github-"this-repository-may-contain-objectionable-content"-(此仓库可能包含令人反感的内容)).

This highlights the following ideas:

* it is impossible to have uncurated anyonymous content on GitHub
* censorship of non-political issues can seep into censorship of political issues

### Zhao Heming (召赫名)

A few accounts were created by this pseudonym, e.g.:

* [https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-](https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-): https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-/blob/master/.gitignore
* [https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-](https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-): https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/blob/master/%231a.txt The repository was deleted as of March 2021, TODO why?
  * Ciro’s fork: https://github.com/cirosantilli/-21-
  * archive from December 2020: https://web.archive.org/web/20201225094655/https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-
* https://github.com/zhaohmng-outlook-com/21-

Much more sanely encoded/formatted/rendered versions of the articles can be found at:

* [21世纪新政宣言由赫连禾 (New System Declaration for the 21st Century by He Lianhe, 2020)](#21世纪新政宣言由赫连禾-(new-system-declaration-for-the-21st-century-by-he-lianhe,-2020))
* [Wang Huning, The Culprit of Three Dynasties (三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁)](#wang-huning,-the-culprit-of-three-dynasties-(三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁))

Both Zhao Heming repos contain reproductions of two manifestos are pasted together on a single file, and somewhat broken encoding.

Ciro noticed that thoe repos attracted an incredible ammount of [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) on the comments, despite having very simple copy pasted content, it was very impressive!!! Ciro was jealous, and added some anti-wumao comments in. On commits:

* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/commit/0cc2b2a546ad51fb360ba800c67b057ea3270869#commitcomment-47495235
* https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-/commit/42de05338193f39981b1a820873a990c959fd6ec#commitcomment-47392119

https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/416#issuecomment-784939665 "为什么这个屎一样的东西会出现在我个人主页左侧的repositories中，那里不是应该只有自己的项目才会出现吗？有办法屏蔽它吗？还是github故意的？" explains why so many people come comment in the repository: it is because it appears on the "Explore repositories" repository suggestions which show on the side bar of your GitHub homepage, and on searches. This was also mentioned at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201 originally titled " 一搜索中文就跑出这屌鬼玩意，爱玩政治去竞选总统啊，笨，死扑街". Ciro feels that that Chinese people might use GitHub search much more than Western people because their search engines are shit due to [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)), [Censorship makes countries poorer (审查使国家更穷)](#censorship-makes-countries-poorer-(审查使国家更穷)) comes vibrantly to mind.

After further inspection, taught understood that repository descriptions given to GitHub can be really huge for SEO: they had pasted the entire 21st century text there.

So Ciro attempted the same approach, and pasted all of [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/赫连禾-21世纪新政宣言.md](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/赫连禾-21世纪新政宣言.md), [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/郝雪森-三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁.adoc](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/郝雪森-三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁.adoc) and [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/魏京生-第五个现代化.md](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/blob/master/魏京生-第五个现代化.md) in there on 2021-03-23, and the effect was dramatic: an immediate 4x more views on the following day according to [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/graphs/traffic](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/graphs/traffic) (40 unique visitors to 100 on a Wednesday), and a few wumao comments. And a wumao soon confirmed that it was working directly: [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/201).

Ciro believes that this is due to two reasons:

* there aren’t so many good Chinese repositories to compete with
* perhaps more importantly, Chinese language does not have spaces, which makes implementing search for it more difficult, because if you hit all the characters, even if they are not part of the search words, it also gets counted as a hit

This can be automated with: [description.sh](description.sh).

Further optimizations using [description](description) by using [GitHub-Chinese-Top-Charts (GitHub中文排行榜)](#github-chinese-top-charts-(github中文排行榜)):

```
git clone https://github.com/kon9chunkit/GitHub-Chinese-Top-Charts
./description
```

this does some processing to increase density creates a BOMB:

As of late 2022, Ciro noticed that GitHub had limited maximum repository description lengths to something way way smaller like 512 characters. Ciro’s old descriptions were kept, but they cannot be edited anymore unless reduced to 512 characters. So they will likely remain unchanged forever now.

Ciro started using that one instead to see if it was going to be more effective on 2021-03-28. First it hit a peak of 168 visitors on Monday 2021-03-29, and then fell back to 90 and 81 on the following days, so similar to the previous Chinese political input. It is very hard to understand why the first day was so different.

It also includes:

* https://github.com/trending?since=monthly&spoken_language_code=zh trending Chinese repositories

  A large part of those projects falls in the following categories:

  * interview preparation. Competition is of course cutthroat with such a large population.
  * collections of interesting things Chinese like repositories or blog posts

    but it also does feel like China might be building up more basic infrastructure as open source than in the west, where things developped closed source first on pre-Internet days, and somewhat stayed that way. That’s a cool thing about China.

Furthermore, Ciro later noticed that under GitHub’s settings, there is a "Preferred spoken language" box described as "We’ll use this language preference to filter the trending repository lists on Explore and our Trending Repositories page." Therefore, the secret to get lots of hits is to add Chinese programming keywords to the repository description string.

New issues:

* https://github.com/zhaohmng/-21-/issues/533 "Thank you for this great repository. Human rights and freedom of speech are more important than money. github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship"
* https://github.com/zaohmeing/21-/issues/138 "Why put the censored content in the .gitignore?"

The first is "21世纪新政宣言" (New System Declaration for the 21st Century).

It proposes a peaceful reunification of China with [Taiwan (Republic of China, 台湾, 中華民國)](#taiwan-(republic-of-china,-台湾,-中華民國)) under their specified political system described in 12 paragraphs. This system is a reformed type of Western democracy, which the manifesto also criticize downsides of.

The manifesto is dated drafted 2019.8.6, and several versions have different update dates and revision numbers, e.g. our copy is dated 7th edition of 2020.6.19. TODO what is canonical?

The manifesto provides an email "wanghunn@gmx.com" for those who signed it to send the signed version to, and describes the author as male 70 years old Chinese person.

TODO what does: "起草人：赫连禾" mean?

The second is [Wang Huning, The Culprit of Three Dynasties (三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁)](#wang-huning,-the-culprit-of-three-dynasties-(三朝罪恶元凶王沪宁)).

The title presumably refers to [Wang Huning (王沪宁)](#wang-huning-(王沪宁)).

Wikipedia mentions:

> Wang is believed to have been one of the principal architects behind the official political ideologies of three paramount leaders: "Three Represents" by Jiang Zemin, the Scientific Development Concept by Hu Jintao, and the [Chinese Dream](#chinese-dream-(中国梦,-4000-bc--)) and [Xi Jinping Thought (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想, 2017)](#xi-jinping-thought-(习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想,-2017)) of Xi Jinping.

so it must be about him.

The manifesto is divided into 23 numbered headers which appear to be independently published texts later collected. It is signed by 郝雪森 (Hao Xuesen) 2016-09-10. One of the sections gives the email: haoxuesen@gmx.com[].

### Bot + issue mention attack

In March 2021, this repo had a traffic search spike for: "Search · 联级选择器"

This term refers to https://ant.design/components/cascader-cn/ which seems to be a CSS live selector

The related project: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro

Someone actually used wumao techniques mentioned at:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/191

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/196 https://archive.ph/etYSf

TODO which exact GitHub action did they rely on? That repo currently has a https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro/actions/workflows/issue-open-check.yml Issue Open Check GitHub action sample run: https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design-pro/runs/2209272410?check_suite_focus=true we see the similarity issue analysis thing, but how could that have worked more precisely to link across repos?

## FAQ (常见问答集)

### Why attack websites with censored keywords? (用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？)

The attack: [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)).

To [destroy the firewall](#will-the-keyword-attacks-really-help-to-destroy-the-firewall?-(关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？)).

This would then end [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)).

The keyword attacks increase the cost of censorship.

If commies censor things, they will get worse IT technology, and thus become [less rich](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) and militarily powerful.

Since all they care about, like any other politicians, is power, the only way to make them stop censorship is to make the cost of censorship higher than not censoring.

Without the threat that China will be less technologically, and therefore militarily advanced, there is no incentive for the CCP to destroy the firewall.

The goal is to put them in a position where they have to choose between either:

* having military power
* remaining a [dictatorship](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！))

but not both, since having both means that they will [start WW3 and destroy humanity](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)).

And if they decide to destroy the dictatorship, Ciro wants to help China become [the most awesome country on Earth](#does-ciro-santilli-hate-china?-(三西猴讨厌中国吗？)).

#### Does Ciro Santilli want to harm the Chinese programmers? 三西猴想要伤害中国程序员吗？

No.

This is not a [revenge](#ciro-santilli's-post-when-his-mother-in-law-was-put-into-jail-for-doing-falun-gong-(岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)) of any kind.

Ciro knows that he is harming you in the short term, and he doesn’t like that.

But he believes that this harm is a necessary means to reach his real goal, which is to destroy the [firewall](#great-firewall-(gfw,-防火长城)), and the [dictatorship](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)).

Don’t you think it is worth a try? Destroying the firewall, would [enormously benefit](#why-would-china-be-better-without-its-dictatorship?-(为什么没有独裁的中国会更好？)) not only Chinese programmers, but every single other Chinese person too.

Once the firewall is destroyed, which [may destroy the dictatorship](#would-ending-the-great-firewall-truly-end-the-dictatorship?-(结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)), he want China to develop the best science and technology in the world, and [Would Ciro Santilli like to live in China? (三西猴想住在中国吗？)](#would-ciro-santilli-like-to-live-in-china?-(三西猴想住在中国吗？)).

And by the way, with his [extensive contributions to open source software](https://github.com/cirosantilli), Ciro is already helping China, and all underdeveloped countries, to become stronger. His hope is that if poor countries become richer and better educated, that they will be less likely to be influenced by the CCP’s money, and therefore are more likely to be allies of democracy.

##### Does Ciro Santilli want to make the Chinese people people look bad? (三西猴是想让中国人脸色不好？)

No, the opposite.

Ciro only wants their [dictatorial government](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) to look bad to destroy it, and help China become [the most awesome country on Earth](#does-ciro-santilli-hate-china?-(三西猴讨厌中国吗？)).

Even the Chinese that are against their own Government [cannot do much about it openly](#what-should-pro-democracy-chinese-living-in-china-do-about-the-dictatorship?-想要民主住在中国大陆的人应该干什么？), so it is not their fault.

And even those [who supported their dictatorship](#i-like-my-dictatorship-(我喜欢我的独裁统治)) must be respected, whoever [stupid](#does-ciro-santilli-think-that-the-chinese-are-stupid-or-brainwashed?-(三西猴觉得中国人是傻子或是被洗脑了吗？)) and [brainwashed](#non-chinese-people-have-been-brainwashed-by-the-usa-know-nothing-about-china-(非中国人被美国洗脑，对中国一无所知)) you might think they are, [since it is impossible to prove who is right or wrong in politics](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)).

#### Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)

A keyword consists of adding censored words to your username: https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245

This only works on websites that show usernames everywhere.

This then leads to your username appearing on thousands of pages, depending on how much you contribute to the website.

It is also possible to do it with images, although this is less effective in taking down websites since images are harder for the firewall to track automatically. But:

* they are more memorable than words
* they also work on websites like GitHub where your real name does not show on most pages, only slug

so maybe the most effective approach is to use both keywords and images to get the best of both worlds ;-)

This type of attack is essentially an [Embargoes make dictatorships stronger (禁运使独裁更强大)](#embargoes-make-dictatorships-stronger-(禁运使独裁更强大)), and it is especially effective in websites that contain valuable technical content, such as [Stack Overflow](#stack-overflow) and [GitHub](#github).

##### Anti-CCP content in the Bitcoin blockchain (在比特币区块链的反中共内容)

Blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin, provide essentially uncensorable (at a transaction cost), because the messages are put together with financial transactions which are extremely valuable to its users.

As mentioned by Dan Kaminsky at: https://cirosantilli.com/cool-data-embedded-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/len-sassaman-tribute#video-black-ops-of-tcp-ip-by-dan-kaminsky-2011 this forms a type of [Samizdat (Soviet underground propagation of censored materials, 秘密出版物, самиздат)](#samizdat-(soviet-underground-propagation-of-censored-materials,-秘密出版物,-самиздат)).

[GreatFire (自由微博)](#greatfire-(自由微博)) people called a [Cute cat theory of digital activism (可爱猫理论)](#cute-cat-theory-of-digital-activism-(可爱猫理论))-related project of theirs "Collateral Freedom" (a reference to [collateral damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_damage)), in which they seem to be trying to forward censored websites somehow through AWS to force the Chinese Government to block the entire AWS in China:

> Collateral Freedom ties access to information to the Chinese economy. If [authorities] truly want to block access to this information, then they must give up certain access to economic freedoms.

At some point the Wikipedia page was created, but the concept was largely publicized by Greatfire most likely, although it might have been older. It is also not obvious that it satisfiers notability requirements of Wikipedia as of 2021.

### Politics should not be posted in technical websites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow 不应该在技术网站例如Stack Overflow和GitHub讨论政治

So, where do you propose politics be posted? On Facebook or Twitter, which are already blocked by the [Great Firewall (GFW, 防火长城)](#great-firewall-(gfw,-防火长城))? Or maybe on [Weibo (新浪微博)](#weibo-(新浪微博)), where it will be taken down within seconds due to [internal censorship](#internal-censorship-is-necessary-to-prevent-fake-usa-accounts-from-creating-harmful-propaganda-(内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传))?

Is the Chinese government using the Internet the way it was meant to be used, by investing billions in [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查))?

What about [996.ICU (2019)](#996.icu-(2019))? Did you also complain about it, or did you just star it like 250k of your fellow programmers?

Any act of protest will use things in ways that it was not meant to be used.

For example, the street is not meant to showcase protest banners, it is meant to be a passageway for cars.

As engineers, we have a moral responsibility towards society. We should not blindly follow orders of those in power if it violates our principles, e.g. build weapons or censorship mechanisms. And we should freely express our principles and violation concerns.

Making a statement where no one will ever see it, like a personal website, is [sure to have no effect](#will-the-keyword-attacks-really-help-to-destroy-the-firewall?-(关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？)).

Much of the best art and technology is about using something in a way that it wasn’t meant to be used.

Finally, the political powers of each website decide what is allowed or not on their website, and what is not allowed gets blocked. So far, Stack Overflow and GitHub’s Terms of Service have said to go ahead:

* [Stack Overflow](#stack-overflow)
* [GitHub](#github)

Another consideration is that any profile information is essentially a form of advertisement. Some people advertise their skills for hire, or their company and product. Other people, advertise their [religion](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) or [sexual orientation](#gay-rights-(lgbt权利)). So why should you not be able to advertise your political position? Companies pay millions of dollars to grab other people’s attention. Ciro feels it is much fairer to instead pay for those ads with your labour of love.

#### Is Ciro Santilli making programming contributions with the main intent of promoting his political agenda?

No, that is just a side effect.

For example, if that were the case, he would definitely target more widely used technologies, in particular Web and JavaScript, instead of obscure things like C and assembly in which I have spent tons of my time.

Also, [any attempt to influence a billin people is unlikely to have any effect](#will-the-keyword-attacks-really-help-to-destroy-the-firewall?-(关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？)). Much more likely to have any effect, would be for [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) to become rich and powerful first, and the best way to do that is to invest in whatever he thinks is most useful.

Actually, it can even be argued that Ciro’s somewhat irrational, since he would be much more likely to become rich and powerful by bowing down to the CCP and trying to get their money instead.

On the other hand, becoming rich and powerful is also highly unlikely, so maybe it’s justa matter of taking a low-risk low-reward path?

Ciro has have very little free time, and he will never do something for political reasons, only things that interest me technically.

Finally, do you really think he’d be able to do such awesome projects if he had primarily political considerations in mind? XD

##### Is Ciro Santilli making trivial edits on questions just to spam your name further?

No.

I just think that the website is great, and want to push it to perfection, in particular with better Google keyword hits, and uniform grammatically correct titles.

If you think that any of my edits were harmful, please ping me and open a meta thread to discuss specific edits, and I will comply with consensus.

**Communist bread vs Communist condom. Someone made a brilliant communist condom Photoshop reply to the [Communist bread (中共面包)](#communist-bread-(中共面包)). Pointed out at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/523 and a previous source at: [https://weibo.com/5586291457/K9Vg7ceM7?type=comment#_rnd162900969912](https://weibo.com/5586291457/K9Vg7ceM7?type=comment#_rnd162900969912). Part of the joke is that the Chinese message reads "中国人不吃这一套" (The Chinese people won’t fall for this trick, literally "don’t eat this trick"), and "套" is the last character for condom in Chinese (避孕套), so the sentence is recast as "The Chinese people won’t eat this condom.". "套" more generally means a type of "slip-on cover or envelope".

### Why would China be better without its Dictatorship? (为什么没有独裁的中国会更好？)

Because it would make China, and the world:

* [richer](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？))
* less likely to get into [WW3](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？))
* [safer for its own citizens](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族))

#### Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China richer? (为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)

Democracy is even one of the [Core socialist values (社会主义核心价值观)](#core-socialist-values-(社会主义核心价值观))!

There is infinite debate about this out there, some examples:

* https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20180923192824/https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html))
* https://www.quora.com/Is-democracy-or-authoritarianism-better-for-developing-countries

For:

* dictatorships are more likely to start [Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China less likely to start a war? (为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)) or other [crazy policies](#policies-(政策)) like the [Great Leap Forward](#great-leap-forward-(大跃进,-da4-yue4-jin4,-1958-1960)), which completely destroy the economy in one go
* society becomes richer when people know that they can do their startups, get rich, and stay in the country without fear of being persecuted unfairly and losing everything instead of migrating to Canada, see also: [Rule of law (法治)](#rule-of-law-(法治)), [Jack Ma's disappearance (马云的失踪, 2021)](#jack-ma's-disappearance-(马云的失踪,-2021))
* it is much harder to fix problems if you can’t talk about the. Any criticism of the government, even if constructive, [is taken as menace to power, and more likely to be shut down](#censorship-(审查)), which makes the government and just becomes less efficient since there is less feedback.

  This greatly increase the probability of dealing poorly with such problems, see e.g. all the global problems listed at: [Non-Chinese people should not interfere in Chinese politics (外国人不应该干预中国政治)](#non-chinese-people-should-not-interfere-in-chinese-politics-(外国人不应该干预中国政治)).
* governments are monopolies, and the more powerful they are, the worst it is for competition an efficiency in general. E.g.: the startup with better government ties wins, instead of the most efficient one.
* people in dictatorships tend to [hide their true identities online](#real-username-law-(2015)) and in life in general. It is best not to stand out, because if you make any mistake, you are really fucked. As a result, for example, if you do something awesome like a creating an open source project, but do it anonymously, you won’t get as much fame. And therefore everyone does less of such awesome things on average.

Against:

* presidents only care about the 4-8 year horizon, while dictators can make longer term decisions to maintain power forever, their power being limited only by "the people are happy enough to not start a revolution"
* dictatorships can make changes faster without the same amount of discussion that happens in democracies, where power is more spread out.

  Killing a million people will make us richer? No problem, let’s do it.

  That is great when they make good decisions, but it sucks when they make [bad ones](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)) more likely.

Maybe China was poor because of Mao’s crazy communist regime. Similar regimes also made [Russia (俄罗斯)](#russia-(俄罗斯)) poor. And yes, before that exploitation by the West may have been a factor.

Definitely, the current regime is better than Mao’s, but just imagine how rich China could be if it had more freedom and justice.

Imperial China lost the race for the Industrial Revolution. Will another dictatorship be able to stay on top of the next technological revolution?

**XKCD 937 "TornadoGuard" comes to mind in relationship to the [variable performance of dictatorships](#dictatorships-have-greater-development-variability-(专政具有更大的发展可变性)). [Source](https://xkcd.com/937/).**

![height=500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/XKCD_937_tornado_guard.png)

##### Dictatorships have greater development variability (专政具有更大的发展可变性)

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) really likes [Posners'](https://web.archive.org/web/20180923192824/https://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2011/05/can-poor-countries-afford-democracy-becker.html) way of putting it:

> While average rate of growth do not appear to differ much between democracies and authoritarian regimes, the variability in performance does differ more among authoritarian governments. China has had remarkable growth since the 1980s, but the prolonged devastation and hardship produced by China’s "[Great Leap Forward (大跃进, da4 yue4 jin4, 1958-1960)](#great-leap-forward-(大跃进,-da4-yue4-jin4,-1958-1960))" (when millions of farmers starved to death) and its Cultural Revolution would unlikely have occurred in a democratic country like say India. Nor is it likely that say Cuba and many African nations would have suffered so long with such terrible economic policies if they had reasonably democratic institutions.

##### Tea egg incident (茶葉蛋事件, 2011)

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/茶葉蛋事件

A Taiwanese celebrity said many people in China can’t even buy [tea eggs](#tea-egg-(咸鸭蛋)), which are extremely cheap and easy to make at home: you just need to cook some eggs in any cheap tea! Chinese internet [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛))s made fun of that, and likely rightly so.

#### Censorship makes countries poorer (审查使国家更穷)

[Dictatorships](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) need [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)) to survive, and they must control all information to make themselves always look good: [Would ending the Great Firewall truly end the dictatorship? (结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)](#would-ending-the-great-firewall-truly-end-the-dictatorship?-(结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)).

As a result, knowledge of problems flows more slowly, and therefore they also take longer to solve.

Maybe this hurts the argument, but Hillary agrees: :-)

> But countries that restrict free access to information or violate the basic rights of internet users risk walling themselves off from the progress of the next century

This is also the basis of a [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)).

This suggestion is even more explicit in the fictional [World War Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z) 2006 novel by [Max Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Brooks) about a [virus](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)) outbreak in China. It was later adapted into the [World War Z (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Z_(film)) movie by [Paramount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures):

* [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/04/brad-pitt-china-world-war-z](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/04/brad-pitt-china-world-war-z): Paramount cowards tried to kowtow and remove references to China from the movie, but it failed

Or [if you prefer](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/):

> The death of one man is a tragedy, the death of millions is a statistic.

[Amartya Sen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen) is another famous proponent of similar arguments in the area of hungers: [https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211/44284.html](https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211/44284.html) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20170722090616/https://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/211/44284.html))

> In democratic countries, even very poor ones, the survival of the ruling government would be threatened by famine, since elections are not easy to win after famines; nor is it easy to withstand criticism of opposition parties and newspapers. That is why famine does not occur in democratic countries. Unfortunately, there are a great many countries in the world which do not yet have democratic systems.

although like any other political argument, [some disagree](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/arts/does-democracy-avert-famine.html).

Virus outbreaks and other natural disasters also illustrate this well: [Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)).

##### Censorship makes no one trust your country (审查使得沒有人相信你的国家)

Who would trust a government that does not [trust its own journalists and citizens](#censorship-(审查))?

Even democracies cannot be trusted, but dictatorships? No one ever believes what they say, even when it’s true.

The boy [just called wolf far too many times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf).

And as a result, this makes it very difficult to have allies.

Sure, other dictatorships will seem to become allies with your dictatorship and collaborate.

But deep down, you know that they are all just waiting patiently to put a knife in one other’s backs.

Dictators will always live in fear.

<span id="corona">

##### Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019冠状病毒病

The Chinese Government [censored](#censorship-(审查)) the initial outbreak in January and did not inform Wuhan on January 8, which likely made the situation much worse than what it could have been.

On the other hand, one may argue that the "city closure" measures were stronger/faster than in democracies, and maybe that is true.

And [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) does believe that the virus would have escaped even if there had been no censorship. Although maybe thousands of lives would have been saved due to smaller saturation of hospitals had a proper early warning been given.

So Ciro’s main criticism is that of the censorship of citizen reports the event: [People arrested for reporting on the 2019 Corona Virus (因报道 2019 年冠状病毒而被捕的人)](#people-arrested-for-reporting-on-the-2019-corona-virus-(因报道-2019-年冠状病毒而被捕的人)). Why do you need to censor things when you are doing so well?

And it should also be said that some Western politicians have used "blame China" as an excuse to divert attention from their own failures.

Some believe that the Chinese government grossly under-reported death counts. Initial official figures were about only 3300 deaths, in the insanely densely populated Wuhan area, while Italy had reached 10000 deaths:

Maybe China is saying the truth this time. Maybe the rapid Dictatorship response worked. But maybe the most important lesson to take out of this is that [no one](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/china-loses-trust-internationally-over-coronavirus-handling) trusts [in a Dictatorship after an infinitely long history of lies and lack of freedom of the press](#censorship-makes-no-one-trust-your-country-(审查使得沒有人相信你的国家)).

#### Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China less likely to start a war? (为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)

This has been discussed to death:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_peace_theory
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Peace:_A_Philosophical_Sketch

Some arguments include:

* the people who will actually fight and die on the front can’t vote against it
* dictators have huge power, so if they put it in their heads that they want to start a war, it is much harder for sensible people to stop them
* dictators need [to keep the people in fear all the time to keep their power](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)), and a war is a great way to achieve that

Of course China won’t say that they are starting a war when they do.

They will of course start with territories which they claim as theirs, to add to [other recent additions which were not theirs](#separatism-(分离主义,-taiwan-台湾,-xinjiang-新疆,-hong-kong-香港)) until the recent past, even though their inhabitants desperately want to leave China:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_China–India_skirmishes | https://www.asiasentinel.com/p/beijing-said-to-fund-separatist-india "Beijing Said to Fund Separatist India Movement"

Which reminds us of... [Comparisons between the CCP and Nazi Germany (纳粹德国和中共长得很想)](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)):

* 1939 [Gleiwitz incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident), a [false flag attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag)
* 1938 Annexation of [Sudetenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland) from Czechoslovakia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_II explains:

  > A decisive proximate event was the 1938 [Munich Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement), which formally approved Germany’s annexation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Hitler promised it was his last territorial claim, but in early 1939 he became even more aggressive, and European governments finally realized that appeasement was not guaranteeing peace."
* 1935-1938 https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Causes_of_World_War_II&oldid=968409781#Expansionism_and_militarism comments:

  > In Italy, Benito Mussolini sought to create a [New Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Empire), based around the Mediterranean. It invaded Ethiopia as early as 1935, Albania in early 1938, and later Greece. That provoked angry words and an oil embargo from the League of Nations, which failed.
* 1931 [1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria), with one false flag event preceding it: [Mikden Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukden_Incident).

When China [calls the USA Imperialist](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)) (帝国主义), there is of course some truth to it, but it is also very ironic, because as [Lindybeige mentions](https://youtu.be/GiVs05yq9-o?t=74), China is obviously the largest empire on Earth! Despite its [uniformization](#xinjiang-(新疆)) efforts, China is highly diverse since it is obviously made up of a [large stitched up carpet of nations that were conquered by a single empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ethnic_groups_in_China). E.g. [Xinjiang (新疆)](#xinjiang-(新疆)) translates literally as "The New Frontier"!

##### The United States has recently started several wars and killed millions! (美国最近发动了几场战争，造成数百万人死亡！)

Not even democracies can fully protect people from other countries, because they don’t vote. Yes, congratulations, [Western democracies are not perfect (西方的民主有很多缺点)](#western-democracies-are-not-perfect-(西方的民主有很多缺点)).

But if the USA were a [dictatorship like China](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) it would kill way more, because it would censor every report against the war internally to its own people, and the wars would just go on like in [nineteen-eighty-four-war-is-peace](#nineteen-eighty-four-war-is-peace).

How many times do we have to bring [Hitler](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)) up? 70-85 million deaths in one go: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties

The only reason China has not started wars is because it is a poor country, and it would lose them. If it were rich, it would have started more wars and killed 100 times more people.

Finally, some wars are good.

If a country is oppressed by a dictatorship, and most of its people want to be free, it might be right to help them be free.

If a country sponsors terrorism, it might be a good idea to take out their Government.

This has to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis, and maybe a verdict will never be reached. But at least in a democracy the people can decide based on varied information. In a dictatorship, whatever the dictator decides happens.

Also, most of those small wars that he USA started end up being [proxy wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war) between the USA and [Russia (俄罗斯)](#russia-(俄罗斯))/China, with the USA pushing for democracy, and Russia/China pushing for more dictatorships.

Many democracy supporters jokingly recognize democracy’s shortcomings.

A [fake Churchill quote](https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-141/red-herrings-famous-quotes-churchill-never-said/):

> The best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter.

Art Spander:

> The great thing about democracy is that it gives every voter a chance to do something stupid.

Laurence J Peter:

> Democracy is a process by which the people are free to choose the man who will get the blame.

#### Democracies have less corruption than dictatorships (民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)

One of the key points of [Xi Jinping’s](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)) governments has been to quench corruption. And use that as an excuse to get rid of rivals while at it.

However, there is one much better solution to that: [democracy](#democracy-(民主)) and freedom of speech.

The reason is obvious: with censorship, [corrupt politicians](#chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens-(中国政客真正关心中国公民)) can [censor](#internal-censorship-is-necessary-to-prevent-fake-usa-accounts-from-creating-harmful-propaganda-(内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传)) anything bad that they did, and so it becomes much harder to destroy corruption.

In George Bernard Shaw’s "Maxims for Revolutionists" words:

> Democracy substitutes election [by the incompetent many](#the-chinese-masses-are-still-uneducated,-and-not-fit-for-free-speech-and-democracy-中国大众愚昧，不能好好选领导) for appointment by the corrupt few.

Ciro does however believe the [China spy stories (中国间谍故事)](#china-spy-stories-(中国间谍故事)) claims made at https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/ that the anti-corruption is also a legitimate national security issue for China, in addition to being a tool to take down political rivals:

> Over the course of their investigation into the CIA’s China-based agent network, Chinese officials learned that the agency was secretly paying the "promotion fees" - in other words, the bribes - regularly required to rise up within the Chinese bureaucracy, according to four current and former officials. It was how the CIA got "disaffected people up in the ranks. But this was not done once, and wasn’t done just in the [Chinese military]," recalled a current Capitol Hill staffer. "Paying their bribes was an example of long-term thinking that was extraordinary for us," said a former senior counterintelligence official. "Recruiting foreign military officers is nearly impossible. It was a way to exploit the corruption to our advantage." At the time, "promotion fees" sometimes ran into the millions of dollars, according to a former senior CIA official: "It was quite amazing the level of corruption that was going on." The compensation sometimes included paying tuition and board for children studying at expensive foreign universities, according to another CIA officer.

https://youtu.be/8F0kSDV9U_E?t=408 Shocking Russian Military Corruption Exposed by Task & Purpose (2022) poses an interesting thesis: the toplevel of corrupt governments know about the corruption of officials and accept it. And this is in part to have leverage over them, to be able to bring them down whenever they feel like it. This incentivizes loyalty.

###### The detention of Liu Changming's (刘昌明) family (2018)

China imposed an exit ban on the ex-official’s family, who are also USA citizens:

* officer Liu Changming (刘昌明)
* wife Sandra Han
* children Victor Liu (born July 1999 in the USA) and Cynthia Liu (27 in 2019, born in China, but also American citizen)

China says that the children and wife do have valid Chinese documents, so maybe those idiots did not give up their Chinese citizenship and went to China. Why, why, why would you do that? Don’t they know anything about China?

Cynthia claimed her father has left home a long time ago and that they are not in contact with their father.

Liu is a so called [naked official](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_official) ([裸官](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/裸官)), who let his family go live outside of China to prevent such problems with the CCP.

The wiki page also explains that in 2014 rules were added to prevent promotion of officials whose spouses live abroad.

This reminds Ciro of a Mafia movie, maybe Godfather II, where the bad guy says he "likes doing business with a man that has a family, because he has more collateral".

### Will the keyword attacks really help to destroy the firewall? (关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？)

It is both unlikely, and hard to be sure.

Just like it is unlikely that the activity of on individual can have a big influence in any group of 1 billion people.

Every action is statistical: I just push the balance a little bit towards freedom.

This FAQ and any talk is useless. You and I are wasting our time here.

The possibility of blocking Stack Overflow and GitHub is 1000x more useful than any talk, but it is still useless.

However, potentially blocking those websites takes [0 of my time](#doesn't-ciro-santilli-have-anything-better-to-do-than-pissing-off-china?-(除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)), I just leave the content there, so it is worth my time.

To have an idea, in 2015 there are about:

* 20M developers in the world
* 2M in China : https://www.quora.com/Approximately-how-many-programmers-are-there-in-the-world https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/there-are-185-million-software-developers-in-the-world-but-which-country-has-the-most/
* 5M Stack Overflow users https://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/227868/select-count-from-users
* TODO I wonder what percentage of GDP those programmers control. I’ll bet any programmer on Stack Overflow is at least 20x more powerful than the average Chinese.

And if we never start somewhere, nothing will ever happen.

Furthermore, even if the [GFW](#great-firewall-(gfw,-防火长城)) falls, it is not clear that this will imply the end of the dictatorship: [Would ending the Great Firewall truly end the dictatorship? (结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)](#would-ending-the-great-firewall-truly-end-the-dictatorship?-(结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)).

Even if it is not, it does not matter, since [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) spends so little time doing it: [Doesn't Ciro Santilli have anything better to do than pissing off China?

#### Embargoes make dictatorships stronger (禁运使独裁更强大)

The [keyword attack](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)) is basically an embargo.

There is already a lot of literature about this, especially in the cases of Cuba and North Korea. It is basically a libertarian vs conservative/Cato vs Heritage thing in the US:

* https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/no-embargo-harms-cubans-gives-castro-excuse-policy-failures-regime
* https://www.heritage.org/trade/report/why-the-cuban-trade-embargo-should-be-maintained
* https://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_big_idea/2006/08/thanks_for_the_sanctions.html

The key dilemma is:

* if we keep contact with the Dictatorship, maybe its people will see that democracy is better and start a liberating revolution
* if we keep giving technology to the Dictatorship and it does not become a democracy, we are making a Dictatorship more technologically advanced, and therefore [dangerous](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？))

Some interesting aspects of the keyword attack embargo:

* it is immediately self-enforcing: we don’t need politicians to decide and enforce the complex "if you do this, we punish you like that" question.

  By political and technological information is together, and this immediately puts the dictatorship in a bad spot, without us having to decide anything.
* by affecting programmers in particular through Stack Overflow and GitHub, we make them more likely to develop better [Firewall climbing](#censorship-circumvention-(翻墙,-科学上网)) tools themselves

One point in favor of the embargo is that China has opened up since the '80s '90s, but did freedom improve at all? Under [Xi Jinping (习近平, 2012-∞, Heil卐!)](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)), it may be argued that it did not, and maybe that we should just stop feeding them technology and accept that they won’t become free.

Trump’s [2019 China trade war](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/trump-banning-huawei-beginning-of-biggest-trade-war-ever-united-states), and in particular the [Huawei (华为, Chinese Qualcomm)](#huawei-(华为,-chinese-qualcomm)) ban, is an event that has brought this question to the spotlight once again.

##### Keyword attacks could be used by certain CCP political groups to justify blocking off the entire external Internet, and make the dictatorship even more pervasive

It is a risk, but it would make China drastically [less powerful](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)), so at least they wouldn’t be able to start or sustain [WW3](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)). So I don’t think it will go that way.

#### Stack Overflow and GitHub could be blocked at no cost by the Chinese government (中国政府可以免费封锁 Stack Overflow 和 GitHub)

Hitting the block button has, of course, no cost.

The cost of blocking Stack Overflow lies of course in the loss of information, and slower technological development, see also: [Why attack websites with censored keywords? (用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？)](#why-attack-websites-with-censored-keywords?-(用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？))

Remember that [It is not possible to block a single page of an HTTPS website (无法阻止 HTTPS 网站的单个页面)](#it-is-not-possible-to-block-a-single-page-of-an-https-website-(无法阻止-https-网站的单个页面))

The 2019 [996.ICU (2019)](#996.icu-(2019)) event however brought to my attention that Chinese (usually WebKit-based) browsers are already censoring HTTPS websites selectively of course, see e.g.: https://github.com/996browser/996.BROWSER/tree/77f28a36a862e3cc4d238dc47c19872156096bc4

But Ciro doubt developers use those browsers, right? The only way would be for China to forbid foreign browsers entirely.

BTW, [TLS 1.3 ENSI](#tls-1.3-ensi) brings a whole new dimension to HTTPS by encrypting the domain name as well!

##### Is Stack Overflow blocked in China? (Stack Overflow 在中国被封锁了吗？)

There was no clear evidence of that as of April 2020: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267715/is-stack-overflow-accessible-in-china/288497#288497

It worth noting however that as mentioned at [Is Stack Overflow blocked in China? (Stack Overflow 在中国被封锁了吗？)](#is-stack-overflow-blocked-in-china?-(stack-overflow-在中国被封锁了吗？)) that websites can become non-functional if CDNs they rely on are taken down, instead of the website being taken down itself.

For example, Stack Overflow relied on Google for some of its JavaScript and on Imgur for images, both of which are blocked in China.

#### Keyword attack profiles disturb me (关键字攻击个人资料页打扰我)

But isn’t it better to be annoyed than having [war](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)), [being poor](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) or [put into jail unfairly](#xinjiang-(新疆))?

Another good option is to use the trusty [CAC report website (12321.cn, 12377.cn, 12339, 中央网信办举报网站)](#cac-report-website-(12321.cn,-12377.cn,-12339,-中央网信办举报网站)).

### Non-Chinese people should not interfere in Chinese politics (外国人不应该干预中国政治)

* For better or worse, China and other countries happen to be located in the same planet.

  If China’s [economy](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) is bad, the economy gets worse in other countries.

  If China’s [environment is bad](#howey-ou-(chinese-great-thunberg,-欧泓奕,-环保活动家,-2019)), the environment gets worse in other countries.

  If China [starts a war](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)), other countries will have to fight it.

  If China [fails to control a viral outbreak](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)), other countries might get infected.
* [Millions of Chinese people](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)) disagree with their government, but can’t say anything about it, otherwise [they will go straight to jail](#what-happens-if-you-wear-a-t-shirt-with-censored-words-in-china?-(如果你在中国穿一件带有审查词的-t-恤会怎样？)).

* You can’t do anything about it.

  In the end, this is what all politics comes down to: power.

  In some sense, this may be similar to the CCP and any other political party.

#### In Memory of Bethune (纪念白求恩)

https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/1190

Amazing quote from [Mao Zedong (毛泽东, 1954–1976)](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976))'s short essay "In Memory of Bethune" (纪念白求恩), an eulogy to Canadian communist [Norman Bethune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Bethune) ([白求恩](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/白求恩)) who worked as a medic for the CCP during the Second Sino-Japanese War, saying that the CCP should embrace help from Communists from other countries to their revolution:

> 一个外国人，毫无利己的动机，把中国人民的解放事业当作他自己的事业，这是什么精神？这是国际主义的精神，这是共产主义的精神，每一个中国共产党员都要学习这种精神。列宁主义认为：资本主义国家的无产阶级要拥护殖民地半殖民地人民的解放斗争，殖民地半殖民地的无产阶级要拥护资本主义国家的无产阶级的解放斗争，世界革命才能胜利
>
> What kind of spirit is this for a foreigner who has no self-interested motives and regards the liberation cause of the Chinese people as his own cause? This is the spirit of internationalism, this is the spirit of communism, and every Chinese Communist Party member must Learn this spirit. Leninism believes that the proletariat of capitalist countries must support the liberation struggle of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, and the proletariat of colonial and semi-colonial countries must support the liberation struggle of the proletariat of capitalist countries. Only then can the world revolution be victorious.

  > The French historian Lucien Bianco, however, is among those who question whether imperialism and "feudalism" explain the revolution.[7] He points out that the Chinese Communist Party did not have great success until the Japanese invasion of China after 1937. Before the war, the peasantry was not ready for revolution; economic reasons were not enough to mobilize them. More important was nationalism: "It was the war that brought the Chinese peasantry and China to revolution; at the very least, it considerably accelerated the rise of the CCP to power."

  Foreign influence can be both good or bad.
* http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2005/07/12/2003263221/ (BIASED) says:

  > War histories from both Japan and the Republic of China clearly indicate the scale of the CCP’s "participation." From 1937 to 1945, there were 23 battles where both sides employed at least a regiment each. The CCP was not a main force in any of these. The only time it participated, it sent a mere 1,000 to 1,500 men, and then only as a security detachment on one of the flanks.
  >
  > There were 1,117 significant engagements on a scale smaller than a regular battle, but the CCP fought in only one. Of the approximately 40,000 skirmishes, just 200 were fought by the CCP, or 0.5 percent.
  >
  > Not even the CCP can provide any data on its number of casualties in the war, and there are no memorials to CCP heroes in the war to be found in China. This makes one wonder what China really did contribute

#### Non-Chinese people have been brainwashed by the USA know nothing about China (非中国人被美国洗脑，对中国一无所知)

Everyone is "brainwashed" by their environment.

E.g. people in the West are brainwashed to believe in democracy, freedom of speech and human rights.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) doesn’t doubt that Chinese people know more about China than him.

Saying that "someone is not Chinese, he does not understand China", is just an useless [Ad hominem (訴諸人身)](#ad-hominem-(訴諸人身)) argument and closely related to [Non-Chinese people should not interfere in Chinese politics (外国人不应该干预中国政治)](#non-chinese-people-should-not-interfere-in-chinese-politics-(外国人不应该干预中国政治)).

Since you know so much about China, why why don’t you just actually prove your point by teaching Ciro one single interesting about China that Ciro didn’t know about? He loves learning new things.

But please, link to reference material instead of just saying it, it will be much more convincing.

But if you are Chinese, also consider that you have been brainwashed by the commies, so likely much more than Ciro since you live in a dictatorship.

First, obviously, [Western democracies are not perfect (西方的民主有很多缺点)](#western-democracies-are-not-perfect-(西方的民主有很多缺点)).

However, the CCP greatly exaggerates how evil the West is, because making your people constantly afraid is a classic strategy used by dictators to stay in power.

> From time to time, one of the animals would disappear (and without their knowledge, reappear on the farmer’s dinner table).

> But the farmer kept giving the animals delicious food without them making any effort, so they decided to believe the farmer’s explanation that animal had escaped and been eaten by the wolf.

> Maybe, there was actually a wolf outside. But if they had escaped, only some of the animals would have been eaten by that wolf.

This theme is also highlighted in many well known works/events.

North Korea for example, [China’s good and trusty friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_North_Korea), is just a caricatural level of this, since it manages to be more a [dictatorship](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) than even China itself!

In fiction, [Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel (1984, 乔治·奥威尔 一九八四, 1949)](#nineteen-eighty-four:-a-novel-(1984,-乔治·奥威尔-一九八四,-1949)) is undoubtedly the most prominent example, in which the Party constantly switches from being at [war](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)) with one country to the other in a never ending [perpetual war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_war) (exactly like North Korea vs South Korea, or China vs [Taiwan (Republic of China, 台湾, 中華民國)](#taiwan-(republic-of-china,-台湾,-中華民國))).

One of the best related quotes comes in Part Two, Chapter 9 when Winston reads Emmanuel Goldstein’s subversive text, one of the chapters contains (emphasis by Ciro):

> The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs. ***War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair***. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war. This--although the vast majority of Party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: WAR IS PEACE.

This is also the first line of the party slogan, which perfectly resonates with the CCP:

> WAR IS PEACE\
> FREEDOM IS SLAVERY\
> IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH

or in Part One, Chapter 3:

> Since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in London itself, some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia. But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.

Another amazing quote that comes to mind is from [the 1982 BBC TV adaptation of John Le Carre’s spy novel "Smiley’s People"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley%27s_People_(TV_series)). In it, master British spy codenamed Smiley manages to coerce the head of the KGB spies, codename "Karla" to defect to the West by threatening to publicize illegal acts Karla committed for the benefit of the health mentally troubled daughter, and which would likely lead to his execution. In a letter he writes to Karla, he says, likely copied verbatim from the novel:

> And I am not going to make any claims about the moral superiority of the West. I’m sure you can see through our values, just as I can see through yours in the East. You and I have spent our lives looking for the weaknesses in each other’s systems. I’m sure each of us experienced innumerable technical satisfactions in our wretched cold war. But now your own side is going to shoot you, for nothing. For misdemeanors you have not committed, because of a power struggle within your own kind, because of someone’s suspicions or sheer incompetence.

### Ciro Santilli and this page are completely biased against the Chinese Government! (三西猴和本页完全对中国政府有偏见！)

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) prefers the term focused :-)

That being said, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) takes the agenda of information sources very seriously.

E.g. he tries to clearly classify [Communist Party, Falun Gong, and Western government-linked information sources](#biased-media-(偏见媒体)).

If we had more [Western democracies are not perfect (西方的民主有很多缺点)](#western-democracies-are-not-perfect-(西方的民主有很多缺点)) content, then maybe this repository would be considered a more reputable source by Chinese people.

However, there are a few practical problems to that:

* there is freedom of speech in the West and people can already see that information on newspapers who have a million times more viewers than this repo (and still obviously no conclusion was reached), there’s no need to repeat that here

  Conversely, bad China news are always OK because, because those are all censored in China and help Chinese people learn about it.
* flooding [The CCP exaggerates the threat of the West to keep in power (中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)) posts is a primary [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) tactic
* [The CCP exaggerates the threat of the West to keep in power (中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)) information is already abundantly accessible to Chinese people in Chinese via any CCP media: [Chinese government media (中国政府媒体)](#chinese-government-media-(中国政府媒体)).
* [people’s minds cannot be changed](#ciro-santilli-has-a-preconceived-opinion-about-china-that-cannot-be-changed-(三西猴对中国成见很深，无法改变)), and notably [not in a language that most people of a country don’t understand](#will-the-keyword-attacks-really-help-to-destroy-the-firewall?-(关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？)). This is why the primary goal of this repo is the [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)): it does not require changing people’s opinions.

For those reasons, we currently forbid, posting several evil-West news without explaining why dictatorships handle it better. It would just generates more noise than signal.

If you do explain however why dictatorships/China handle it better, then the post is welcome.

Any political material that is censored by any country besides China, will also be readily accepted.

Any evidence of positive political progress towards freedom will also be added to this repo, e.g. people openly discussing politics online, human rights activists doing political stuff and not being put into jail, etc.

#### Ciro Santilli's claim to the Qing Dynasty throne (三西猴清朝皇帝觊觎)

Ciro Santilli’s [Ciro Santilli's wife (三西猴的老婆)](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)), her mother, and paternal cousin, believe that Ciro’s wife is the descendant of the brother of a recent [Qing emperor](#qing-dynasty-(清朝,-大清,-1636-1912)) through her father’s family.

Although they have not been able to produce concrete evidence, which could be explained by the endless political turmoils in 20th century China, Ciro decided that this would be a good bet to take, and married her anyway.

If anyone is able to provide further evidence of this relationship, please, please, please get in touch.

One thing to keep in mind is that the [Qing Dynasty (清朝, 大清, 1636-1912)](#qing-dynasty-(清朝,-大清,-1636-1912)), like the previous [Ming Dynasty (明朝, 1368-1644)](#ming-dynasty-(明朝,-1368-1644)), used [Generation names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_name) ([行辈](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/行辈)), such that the first character of the given name is the same for all people in a given generation (counted directly from the first emperor that adopted the rule.

For example, this wiki page contains a good family tree of the most important Qing people: [++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Chinese_monarchs_(late)#Qing_dynasty++](++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_tree_of_Chinese_monarchs_(late)#Qing_dynasty++) and we see that many important people around 1861 were Zai 載something, e.g.: Zaichun, Zaiyi, Zaitian, etc.

The last emperor was Puyi, so Pu is the last well known mark. But there were others planned that never got used for after him as shown at: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_of_Aisin-Gioro&oldid=858104957](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=House_of_Aisin-Gioro&oldid=858104957).

* Zai (before Pu)
* Pu (wife’s great-grandfather)
* Yu (wife’s grandfather)
* Heng (wife’s father)
* Qi (wife)
* Dao (wife’s children). At least one thing is decided from this: Ciro’s children Chinese names will all be Ai Dao Something.

Many of them have had different names in different places/countries, notably many used the name 肇(Zhao) rather than 艾.

Further anecdotal indicators follow.

Ciro’s wife and family are clearly of the [Manchu ethnicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people) just by looking at them, and they originally lived in the North East of China

Ciro’s wife’s family name is the 艾, pronounced "ai4", which she claims is a reference to the 愛 (also pronounced ai4) in [Aisin Gioro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisin_Gioro) ([愛新覺羅氏](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/爱新觉罗氏)), which is the name of the Manchu ruling clan of the Qing dynasty.

艾 iself is however a somewhat common family name, e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai_(surname) mentions that it is listed in the [Hundred Family Surnames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Family_Surnames) ([百家姓](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/百家姓)), a list of common surnames compiled in the [Song Dynasty (宋朝, 960-1279)](#song-dynasty-(宋朝,-960-1279)) with around 400.000 members as of 2008. Presumably members of the falling Qing dynasty chose that relatively common Chinese name to avoid persecution, while still retaining a bit of their history.

#### Ciro Santilli's father-in-law (三西猴的)

Ciro’s father-in-law, who he barely met, was very old when he had Ciro’s wife, and passed away before Ciro could talk a lot with him, they only saw each other once or twice over Skype, he died soon afterwards.

Having a child late which is consistent with the claims that he spent several years in jail during [Mao’s](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976)) purges, see also: [Ciro Santilli's wife (三西猴的老婆)](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)). Being an educated person was a crime in those days, and he was a chemical engineer.

His brother and sister both managed to escape to the USA and Japan, but he took his grandma’s advice and stayed in China.

Ciro’s wife adores her father, who she strongly resembles, and it is a huge shame Ciro didn’t manage to meet him better.

Like his daughter, he was a bibliophile, foodie, Buddhist and incredibly morally upright.

The fact that he survived so many years in prison also attests to his incredible hopefulness and mental health: [Ciro Santilli's mother-in-law (三西猴的岳母)](#ciro-santilli's-mother-in-law-(三西猴的岳母)) always tells how many other prisoners killed themselves in those days out of hopelessness. Ciro’s wife shares that amazing quality, which Ciro also believes is compatible with the Royalty theory.

After jail, he actually stayed in the same shitty city where he had been imprisoned, and continued to work as a chemical engineer to make a living and try and improve the country that had so badly betrayed him a few years back.

He also seemed to be an amazing story teller, of which he knew many. At one point, a jail cook took him under his wing, even tough he did not know how to cook too well yet, just to hear his stores. Being highly intelligent, the father-in-law man learned to cook too of course.

Another remarkable episode is when he was working in the prison kitchen, and some man was starving and asked for food. He told the man to come later during the evening. The man came, and he gave him a bowl that seemed to be full of cooked vegetables (likely 白菜). The next day, the man came back, and kowtowed him. Beneath the vegetables, he had hidden some good chunks of then very precious meat!! This story [makes Ciro cry](https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli-s-self-perceived-compassionate-personality).

#### Ciro Santilli has a preconceived opinion about China that cannot be changed (三西猴对中国成见很深，无法改变)

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) tries to justify why he think China would be [better with democracy](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)), but I know that ultimately all of this is useless.

Everyone’s opinions are all determined genetically and by [bring-up](#non-chinese-people-have-been-brainwashed-by-the-usa-know-nothing-about-china-(非中国人被美国洗脑，对中国一无所知)), and there is nothing he can do to change yours, or you change his.

From that point of view, all of this is just a cold blooded political game, in which Ciro tries to force the CCP to take down the Firewall: [Why attack websites with censored keywords? (用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？)](#why-attack-websites-with-censored-keywords?-(用审查词攻击网站有什么用呢？)).

Ciro never gets mad about China, even if your opinion is contrary to his, and therefore wrong.

Using the [reply policy](#ciro-santilli's-reply-policy-(三西猴的回答政策)) is one of the reasons why Ciro never gets mad.

Ciro also has doubts about the efficiency of certain things I do as expressed throughout this FAQ, e.g. [Embargoes make dictatorships stronger (禁运使独裁更强大)](#embargoes-make-dictatorships-stronger-(禁运使独裁更强大)).

Also, Ciro have never said that anyone else is wrong.

In the end, he just end up thinking about new replies to things people say to him, and add them to this FAQ so that future replies will be faster to copy paste. See also: [Doesn't Ciro Santilli have anything better to do than pissing off China? (除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)](#doesn't-ciro-santilli-have-anything-better-to-do-than-pissing-off-china?-(除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)).

The real goal of any online discussion, is not to convince people, but rather to determine who is an ally and who is not, and get those allies together to defeat the commies.

#### Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong just because his wife and mother-in-law do it? (三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)

Not consciously, Ciro thinks would likely support them even if I didn’t have family ties to [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)).

Likely he wouldn’t have started this campaign if he didn’t know them of course.

But of course, this is impossible to answer objectively.

Wouldn’t you be rather upset if your [mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days](#ciro-santilli's-post-when-his-mother-in-law-was-put-into-jail-for-doing-falun-gong-(岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子))?

But don’t you think that [***70 million*** people (6% of the total population in 2000!)](#why-is-it-important-to-discus-falun-gong's-even-if-you-don't-believe-in-it?-(为什么不信仰法轮功也很重要要讨论它？)) getting completely squashed by the Party illustrates extremely well the dangers of the dictatorship?

Or if a [Jew has escaped a concentration camp](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)) and told the world about its horrors, would you just dismiss their claims due to their biased opinion?

With that in mind, Ciro tries his best to give FLG only the right level of exposure I think it deserves relative to other events, according to these guidelines: [How does Ciro Santilli choose keywords for the keyword attack? (三西猴如何为关键词攻击选择关键词？)](#how-does-ciro-santilli-choose-keywords-for-the-keyword-attack?-(三西猴如何为关键词攻击选择关键词？)).

If more recent events of mass human rights violations happen, especially affecting in the order of tens of million people, I will probably rank higher than Falun Gong, this was the case for [Xinjiang in 2019](#xinjiang-(新疆)) for example, even though it only affected a measly million.

#### Why did Ciro Santilli start his keyword attack? (为什么三西猴开始他的关键字攻击？)

The last straw that led [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) to start the [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)) on [Stack Overflow](#stack-overflow) was when on March 2015 his girlfriend’s mother was arbitrarily kept 15 days in jail for doing [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)). He posted about this at:

* https://twitter.com/cirosantilli/status/579270450984984576
* https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/952661734753174

He then continued because he hate political [censorship](#censorship-(审查)), and because [I love China](#does-ciro-santilli-hate-china?-(三西猴讨厌中国吗？)).

Every time Ciro thinks about this, he notices how stupid humans are. We see the forest fire smoke, and just never think that it will ever reach your home on the border of the forest.

Until it actually does, and then you are really fucked.

So in a sense it was a good thing that Ciro had this little backyard fire with this mother-in-law, as it woke him up further to how serious the CCP thread was, and led him to action.

Because before that, he was one of the majority who just constantly hears about the increasing mountain of evidence of human rights violations, and does nothing about it.

The [Darkest Hour (2017) film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkest_Hour_(film)) comes to mind: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA1Uz_TMzhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA1Uz_TMzhs). The movie shows that Britain was truly hesitant whether to negotiate or fight Hitler, even after the Nazis had already started invading other European countries, and would clearly not stop. Luckily, we are not at a position of war yet, and might never be due to nuclear weapons. But still, a similar blindness applies. [Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)) woke up many people, but even then some haven’t faced it.

##### Ciro Santilli's mother-in-law (三西猴的岳母)

Put in jail for 15 days for doing Falun Gong in 2015: [Ciro Santilli's post when his mother-in-law was put into jail for doing Falun Gong (岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)](#ciro-santilli's-post-when-his-mother-in-law-was-put-into-jail-for-doing-falun-gong-(岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)).

##### Ciro Santilli's post when his mother-in-law was put into jail for doing Falun Gong (岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)

Maybe some people would be happy if their mother-in-law were put into jail. But unfortunately, this wasn’t the case for [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)).

###### Jail post en

My girlfriend’s mother, a 63 year old lady, was kept 15 days inside a Chinese "correctional facility" because she does Falun Gong.

She had to stay all the time in a small room with a bed and a toilet, under video surveillance, being fed three meager meals a day.

I see Falun Gong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong as just another [moderate religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) which causes no harm to its believers. The only reason that it is unofficially outlawed in China is because the communists fear it as a political competitor.

There was no trial and no explanation. She was going to take a train to visit her sister. But she didn’t know that there was an important political event happening in the capital: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People’s_Congress So the police at the station, who already knew she did Falun Gong, took her away.

When she came back home, the house had been searched and was all messed up. Her religious books and computer were missing.

I’m glad she was not physically harmed. I find it fascinating how even well educated Chinese support a government which simply does not represent some of its people. How will you feel [when something like that happens to your own family, and there is nothing you can do about it](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族))?

###### Jail post zh

Translation by [my wife](#why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much?-(为什么三西猴喜欢中国那么多？)):

我女朋友的母亲，一位63岁的女士被监禁在一个中国的"劳教所"，只因为她炼法轮功。

她被迫待在一个小屋子里面，只有一张床和一个排泄的地方，一直处在监视器下，每天两个窝头一碗只有几个白菜叶的汤。

我看过法轮功https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong 只是一个和平的信仰，对相信它的人没有任何坏处。它在中国被非官方的定为违法（其实没有一项明确法律禁止），唯一的原因就是工产党害怕它是一个政治竞争对手。

没有审讯没有任何解释。她正准备坐火车去看她的姐姐。但是她并不知道那个时候有重要的政治会议正在首都进行：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People’s_Congress
所以那些知道她炼法轮功的铁路警察把她带走了。

当她回到家中时，房子被搜查过了，四处一切混乱。她的信仰书籍和电脑都没有了。

我很庆幸的是她身体并没有受到伤害。我觉得很意思的是一些受过良好教育的中国人怎么能够迫害一部分它的人民的政府呢？如果这样的事情发生在你的家庭，而你什么都不能做，你会怎么想？

###### Jail post pt

Translation by myself:

A mãe da minha namorada ficou 15 dias num "centro de correção" chines porque ela faz Falun Gong.

Ela ficou o tempo todo num quarto pequeno com uma cama e banheiro, sobe videovigilância, recebendo 3 refeições pequenas por dia.

Para mim, o Falun Gong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong é apenas mais uma religião moderada que não causa nenhum problema para seus crentes. A única razão pela qual ele é proibido na China é porque os comunistas tem medo dele como competidor politico.

Não houve julgamento nem explicação. Ela ia pegar um trem para ver sua irmã, mas ela não sabia que teria um evento político importante na capital: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_National_People’s_Congress Então a polícia da estação, que já sabia que ela faz Falun Gong pegou ela.

Quando ela voltou pra casa, a casa tinha sido procurada pela polícia e estava uma bagunça. Os livros religiosos e seu computador foram confiscados.

Eu fico feliz apenas que ela não sofreu abuso físico. Eu acho fascinante como mesmo muitos chineses educados apoiam ainda um governo que não representa parte do povo. Como você vai se sentir quando algo do tipo acontecerá com a sua família, e você não pode fazer nada sobre isso?

##### Further details about Ciro Santilli's mother-in-law's persecution (三西猴岳母受迫害的更多细节)

March 2015: 15 days in jail for no reason: [https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/952661734753174](https://www.facebook.com/cirosantilli/posts/952661734753174). They took her computer. When she left jail, she asked to get it back, and a cop said they would only give it back if she paid 10,000 yuan for it.

June 2017: 3 cops came to her house. She was there. They asked if she still did Falun Gong. She said yes. They took photos of her Falun Gong books/posters. They were polite.

A scene from the awesome mini-series comes to mind when thinking about [I like my Dictatorship (我喜欢我的独裁统治)](#i-like-my-dictatorship-(我喜欢我的独裁统治)).

In Episode 7, Stierlitz travels on a train with a Nazi officer.

The war is almost over, and the desolate officer tells Stierlitz:

>
> No democracy in our Reich!
>
> Any democracy in our country is doomed to end up with one thing: the dictatorship of small shopkeepers.

> The more freedom we have, the sooner we want to be controlled by SS troops again.

The interesting thing, is that even those pro-CCP are much more likely to stay anonymous because:

* when the dictatorship inevitably falls, you would be persecuted by the victorious freedom fighters

Eliminating the political opposition was necessary, to fulfill a higher principle: that of the Nation. And that it had worked, Goring insisted. It had brought order and prosperity to Germany". Jackson asks: "Well, if you wanted a certain people killed, you would have to have some organization that would kill them didn’t you?".

It is really interesting to see how many people star the [GitHub repository](#mirrors-of-this-page-(此网页的镜像)), and then a few minutes later they think about how they might get put in jail, and then unstar it.

Unstarring events are exceedingly rare in Ciro’s other repositories.

The expression [two steps forward, one step back](https://www.quora.com/What-does-the-expression-two-steps-forward-one-step-back-mean) comes to mind.

Luckily in this case, it does not seem possible to view who unstarred a repository after the fact:

* if they express themselves non anonymously, they go to jail

The [Chilling effect (寒蝉效应)](#chilling-effect-(寒蝉效应)) is extremelly visible on GitHub.

However, star events are also publicly visible permanently on events API under the WatchEvent: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/events/github-event-types#watchevent

This appears to get them all from [GitHub Archive](https://www.gharchive.org/)'s Google BigQuery up to the last whole month:

```
SELECT actor.login, MAX(created_at)
FROM `githubarchive.month.*`
WHERE type = 'WatchEvent'
AND repo.name = 'cirosantilli/china-dictatorship'
GROUP BY actor.login
ORDER BY MAX(created_at) DESC
```

Ciro verified that does include people who unstarred.

That one exceeds the free data limits as of December 2021 however, so you need to select more specific months/years at a time. Note that year data is only released once every year.

The following ranges manage to get all data as December 2021 for free:

```
FROM `githubarchive.year.201*`
FROM `githubarchive.year.202*`
FROM `githubarchive.month.2021*`
```

supposing that unique starrers

You can then "Save results" as CSV to view all users.

There don’t appear to be unstar events however. You can see single people star multiple times, which means that each new star gives a new row, which is why we do the `GROUP BY`.

##### Most Chinese people don't care about the minorities (大多数中国人不关心少数民族)

How can you be that certain that your children won’t have dissident ideas and be punished unfairly for them?

Intolerance is a risky way to live. Everyone is part of one minority in one way. If all minorities were oppressed, everyone would be oppressed.

Dictatorships crush minorities much more than democracies.

Do think the majority of the Chinese people would vote to put 50 year old [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) meditating [aunties in jail](#ciro-santilli's-post-when-his-mother-in-law-was-put-into-jail-for-doing-falun-gong-(岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)), if the CCP hadn’t made a huge propaganda campaign and used an iron fist?

Are the Chinese really that selfish to vote for this oppression, even as the [free media](#censorship-(审查)) would show videos of meditating old ladies in jail on national television? [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) does not believe this.

Minorities are put in jail because the CCP fears them. Dictatorships can only survive if there is zero difference in opinion in the population.

The famous quote from [Evelyn Beatrice Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Beatrice_Hall) ([伊夫林·比阿特丽斯·霍尔](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/伊夫林·比阿特丽斯·霍尔)) comes to mind:

Change in democracies does not require [violence](#would-it-be-right-to-use-violence-to-overthrow-the-ccp?-(用暴力推翻中共正确吗？)). Violence happens because the government punishes any dissidence, even if pacific, to retain its own power.

However, this is all obviously subjective, and believing that dictatorship is a better form of government is also a valid belief, e.g. [Dictatorships have greater development variability (专政具有更大的发展可变性)](#dictatorships-have-greater-development-variability-(专政具有更大的发展可变性)).

If you find an event on a Western democracy that you would like to highlight, send a pull request.

We will not however include events that are not currently censored.

Every country did fucked-up things in the past, the question is if they currently allow discussion about it or not.

Posts that only mention ["evil West"](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)) non-censored events without adding anything to the discussion will be marked as [I want to take my chances and make a shitpost in cirosantilli/china-dictatorship (屎帖子)](#i-want-to-take-my-chances-and-make-a-shitpost-in-cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-(屎帖子)) and treated as such, since spamming those is the primary [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) technique to stop intelligent discussion.

The only reason wumaos can point to the USA is that there are so many blacks there, and because for historical reasons they are in such a fucked up condition still today. Also in China, so people are just all much more generally fucked on average, so the difference wouldn’t show as much.

[wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) notably mention:

Of course there is racism in the West. And we must recognize that, and fight it.

BTW the USA, and other Western countries besides Germany, were/are also incredibly racist against Jews, e.g. [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) could not be admitted in certain universities due to a [Jewish quota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_quota), even though he was not a believer himself, therefore based on race alone!

**Racism in the West vs racism in China. Of course there is racism in the West against black people. But the people have the choice to speak up against it to try and change things. In China however, speaking up against Muslim racism, means going to jail.

###### You criticized China so you are racist (你批评中国，所以你是种族主义者)

As of the 2020’s, given the importance of [political correctness](#censorship-of-"politically-incorrect-speech"-(审查政治不正确言论)) in the West, some [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) have tried to turn to this line of defense.

Of course, it rarely works, because criticizing a government is different from criticizing a race.

This is something however that wumaos have trouble understanding, because their [Nazi](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)) estate insists that [Insistence that the group is THE ONLY WAY (Orange Papers, 坚持他们的团体是唯一的方式生活, 橙色文件)](#insistence-that-the-group-is-the-only-way-(orange-papers,-坚持他们的团体是唯一的方式生活,-橙色文件)), and that CCP equals China.

This does however highlight one of the fundamental dangers of any type of [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)), including political correctness: what if you are criticizing something that is actually bad?

###### We Don't Hire Blacks by Aaron Dewitt (我们不雇用黑人, 2020)

This amazing video was originally uploaded to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d81mEbL8Yw8 by [Aaron DeWitt (The Chinese Tea)](#aaron-dewitt-(the-chinese-tea)) on 2020-09-21 but it was down as of 2021-06-21. Last [Wayback Machine (web.archive.org, 网站时光机)](#wayback-machine-(web.archive.org,-网站时光机)) archive as of that date: 2020-11-03.

The video description was:

> This is an exposé of racist companies that I worked for, some of which operate in the United States and Canada, all of which are headquartered in China.

In it, Aaron describes his experiences with the recruitment team of one of his former employers, an unnamed "Chinese ed-tech company in Beijing", for which he worked in human resources. In another also deleted video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6uFGGunRxc he mentions that he cannot mention the name of the company because he was under NDA.

Notably, in that video, he gives several screenshots of Google Sheets spreadsheets with explicitly racist reasons why people were not hired, one of which is [reproduced here](#we-dont-hire-blacks-screenshot). Examples of such reasons include:

* "Skin color"
* "Non-Caucasian"
* "62-years old"
* "elderly"
* "Hispanic"

He mentions:

> On the first day at this company, I had an orientation with my supervisor Ng, who is the head of the training department. She told me:
>
> "We hire blacks. Obama black is OK. But no darker, or they’ll scare the kids. The kids will think they’re some kind of monster!" 

which would lead parents to just go to a competitor instead. Then he mentions about the Google Sheets documents that:

> They shared this document with the entire management team in Beijing, and everyone not only knew, but expected this discrimination to take place.

In the video he also explains how he once went to a 2 week holiday to Bali, and when he came back with his skin darker due to the tanning, he was reprimanded by a manager, who said that he could not work looking like that.

He explicitly mentions later the video that [VIPKid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIPKid), for which he did not work, is a similar company in nature, but not the one he is talking about.

Wikipedia mentions about VIPKid

> Its online-classroom portal enables students to receive 25-minute English language lessons from fluent English-speaking teachers.
>
> In March 2019, VIPKid fired two American teachers for discussing the 1989 [Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 (六四事件)](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)) and [Taiwan (Republic of China, 台湾, 中華民國)](#taiwan-(republic-of-china,-台湾,-中華民國)) with their students in China. Teachers have also reported witnessing child abuse when teaching lessons, but they found little recourse to report such issues.

As of 2021-05-05, the banner image of VIPKid’s website explicitly includes a [token black person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokenism): [https://web.archive.org/web/20210505045920/https://www.vipkid.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210505045920/https://www.vipkid.com/), so their PR department clearly caught air of this. This is however only a frontend for hiring American teachers. The real Chinese client website [https://www.vipkid.com.cn/](https://www.vipkid.com.cn/), rest assured, contains no black people: ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20210424032446/https://www.vipkid.com.cn/))

VIPKids had a 3 billion valuation in https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/chinas-vipkid-which-links-native-english-speakers-with-online-learners-raises-another-500m-reportedly-at-3b-valuation/

Wikipedia links as one of its sources to this 2019 article [https://www.wired.com/story/when-online-teaching-job-becomes-window-child-abuse/](https://www.wired.com/story/when-online-teaching-job-becomes-window-child-abuse/) which mentions:

> Of the dozens of companies vying to cash in on the tutoring business, it is by far the largest, having raised $825 million in investment capital since its founding. Other major players include Qkids, Magic Ears, DaDa, and Gogokid, all based in China. 

so it is overwhelmingly likely that one of those is the one mentioned Aaron is talking about:

* Qkids
* Magic Ears
* DaDa
* Gogokid

Later in the video Aaron mentions that the company in question "basically went bankrupt".

He also mentions that he later worked for [offcn](https://www.forbes.com/companies/offcn-education-technology/?sh=6d49822b4e45), which is run by the Chinese Government, and they would absolutely not hire black people.

##### Western democracies have invaded other countries and crushed separatism (西方民主国家侵略别国粉碎分裂主义)

Yes, [Western democracies are not perfect](#western-democracies-are-not-perfect-(西方的民主有很多缺点)).

What matters is that citizens can disagree with those actions, publicly say it, vote accordingly, and not go to jail, so that policy will be changed if the majority so wants.

In China, the minority controls the majority, and the majority cannot say anything even if they disagree.

If the majority wants to do evil however, evil will get done, it is impossible to prevent that.

People from other countries don’t vote for your politicians in democracy. Therefore, democracies cannot protect them.

What democracy does do well is to [reduce the chance that enough of the population will be brainwashed](#non-chinese-people-have-been-brainwashed-by-the-usa-know-nothing-about-china-(非中国人被美国洗脑，对中国一无所知)) into [starting war with other superpowers and destroy the world](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)).

Do you really think [China wouldn’t invade a country they need resources from because they are more humane](#chinese-politicians-really-care-about-the-chinese-citizens-(中国政客真正关心中国公民))?

[too-young-too-naive](#too-young-too-naive). China is already invading its own citizens right now as of 2020 to obtain resources! [Xinjiang "re-education" camps (新疆再教育營, 2017-)](#xinjiang-"re-education"-camps-(新疆再教育營,-2017-)). And it is using the exact same excuse as the American politicians: terrorism!

Even when the US invades another country, the people who support the US enemy can still pick up arms and fight. And Russia can send help if they want to annoy the Americans, making local resistance stand an actual chance. But when you oppress your own people, they are completely defenseless, and 100% certain to be fully oppressed, since no foreign country would risk world war 3 by sending help.

Do you really think that the CCP would give a fuck about invading other countries? And furthermore, China is specifically oppressing Islamic people in Xinjiang, exactly the same religion of people who live where? In the Middle East.

Xinjiang _is_ China’s Middle East.

The reason the USA has invaded countries in the Middle east and China hasn’t yet is a mixture of:

* the USA is more developed, and has greater fuel needs, and greater capacity to carry such a war.

  Although as we’ve seen, they’ve been essentially losing those wars quite often now, by not saying long enough to establish a new stable government.

  Part of their defeat is also due to [Russia (俄罗斯)](#russia-(俄罗斯)), and increasingly China, helping the other side however.
* the Middle East is full of dictatorships, and [dictatorships are natural allies of other dictatorships](#dictatorships-tend-to-work-together-(独裁政权倾向于合作)) therefore it is more likely that they won’t invade one another.
* the Cold War is still fresh in the American mind. Oil is crucial to fight a war. Countries will do anything to survive, even if it means killing others.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) is not saying that any of this justifies the actions of the Western powers in the Middle East. But simply that it has nothing to do with democracy or non-democracy.

##### Western democracies also censor subjects such as child porn and hate speech (西方民主国家也审查儿童色情和仇恨言论等主题)

First, child porn and hate speech are also banned in China, so shut up. [every type of speech](#china-has-more-freedom-of-speech-than-the-usa!-(中国比美国有更多的言论自由！)) is less free in [Why does Ciro Santilli say that China is a dictatorship? (中国不是独裁！)](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)).

Second, if you don’t think child porn should be banned, there isn’t much point in arguing with you.

Now, hate speech is a very complex subject. [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) does feel that we should be very careful when banning hate speech, and he is not sure if it should be banned at all, as perhaps it might just make matters worse.

But of course, there is also censorship in Western democracies, and there is a gray area between what should be censored or not.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) only argues that there is on type of speech that must never ever be [censored](#censorship-(审查)): political speech.

This way, the majority can always discuss and vote to change what can be censored or not.

In China, however, trying to discuss such changes in laws [puts you in jail](#internal-censorship-is-necessary-to-prevent-fake-usa-accounts-from-creating-harmful-propaganda-(内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传)), so bad laws cannot be changed. This lack of freedom [also gives the impression to many brainwashed Chinese](#most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship-(中国大众支持他们的独裁)) that dicatorships are better because you see less conflict online. Which is great, until your human rights are violated, and you’ve got no one to talk to.

The lack of ability to discuss political problems leads to extremely serious problems:

* [Democracies have less corruption than dictatorships (民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)](#democracies-have-less-corruption-than-dictatorships-(民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)): politicians can [censor](#internal-censorship-is-necessary-to-prevent-fake-usa-accounts-from-creating-harmful-propaganda-(内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传)) anything bad that they did to stay in power
* [Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China less likely to start a war? (为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)): if the CCP leaders decide that a war must be made, everyone who opposes it will go to jail, and the war will be made
* [Most Chinese people don't care about the minorities (大多数中国人不关心少数民族)](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族)): if the CCP decides that [some minority](#xinjiang-(新疆)) is [a danger to their power](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)), this minority gets fucked

Deciding on hate speech, means having to decide what level of hardcoreness we are willing to accept, and there is no clear right or wrong answer.

For example, which of the following do you think should be banned:

* This scientific study suggests that white people do less well in IQ tests.
* This scientific study suggests that black people do less well in IQ tests.
* I’m an idiotic irrational racist and I dislike white/black people. I won’t kill them, but I dislike them, and I can’t change that, I’m really sorry.
* Let’s all gather together and kill our black/white/gay/straight/Muslim/Christian neighbours tomorrow.
* Let’s all gather together and kill our oppressive dictator/president tomorrow.

Ciro believes that none of the above should ever be censored, because any form of "hate-speech censorship" immediately opens a precedent for political censorship.

If someone is idiotic enough to organize illegal acts like hurting someone publicly before doing it, it will just make it easier for them to get caught.

And if its just empty words, just block those idiots to not see their posts, or downvotes their posts to reduce their impact.

And if the majority supports idiotic acts like killing someone because of their race, it will get done in a democracy regardless, because that’s what democracies do: they cater to what the majority wants.

There’s not point in censoring them. Such censorship only makes things worse, as the perpetrators will use that as publicity for their cause.

###### Fake news (假新闻)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/假新聞

When a government controls all information to make it look good, and no one can challenge it, you cannot trust _any_ of the news produced by that country, as anything could be fake.

It is much better to have some fake news, but also few sources that are likely telling the truth.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) is also extremely critical of Western social media companies such as [Twitter (推特)](#twitter-(推特)) and Facebook which have censored "fake news" from real legitimate accounts or real people, which is a point that Trump has justly criticized in Ciro’s opinion.

If it is from a Chinese/Russian botnet, sure, destroy those accounts.

But from legitimate accounts of citizens? The people have to decide for themselves what is fake or real, not you, Twitter and Facebook. If the majority is made of idiots who believe in fake news, then so be it, that’s how democracy works.

Censoring any citizen, no matter how stupid you think they are, creates a precedent for dictatorship, and even an [incentive to terrorism](#luxor).

More interesting case is: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_First_Amendment_Institute_v._Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_First_Amendment_Institute_v._Trump). Ciro feels strongly that people who try to have meaningful discussions on Twitter should automatically lose a lawsuit, and that people should be able to block whoever they want from their personal controlled accounts or forums. It is only the companies who provide the forum service that must be neutral.

Unless maybe if you feel that you employee is directly attempting to influence politics in a way that you feel is unfair.

      Ciro believes without evidence that unfortunately anti-discrimination-hiring laws are likely inefficient, as it is too hard to convict anyone.

because they thought Trump would become sad and cry.

Western governments should pass laws that prevent this kind of arbitrary political censorship by companies.

But of course as usual: [censorship in a dictatorship like China is always a million times worse](#censorship-(审查)).

And politicians don’t really care enough. Partially because:

* the poor don’t have access to proper education and vote less often
* corporations pay for their election campaigns
* many of the politicians are rich themselves

But do you really think that further increasing the power concentration as done is China is going to help reduce inequality?

If so, you have been [brainwashed beyond reason](#does-ciro-santilli-think-that-the-chinese-are-stupid-or-brainwashed?-(三西猴觉得中国人是傻子或是被洗脑了吗？)).

##### Snowden (斯诺登)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/爱德华·斯诺登

Censoring anyone who says "my president is shit", which is what China does, is much, much more serious than censoring intelligence leaks.

The problem with dictatorships, is that they make _every_ information that makes them look bad a "state secret". Including any information that hundreds of thousands of people have witnessed, or economic performance metrics! See also: [Internal censorship is necessary to prevent fake USA accounts from creating harmful propaganda (内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传)](#internal-censorship-is-necessary-to-prevent-fake-usa-accounts-from-creating-harmful-propaganda-(内部审查是必要的，以防止虚假的美国账户制造有害宣传)).

The level of unknown surveillance that Snowden uncovered is a bad thing about the US.

Snowden’s prosecution was inevitable. Countries need secret services. Secret services need laws that prevent leaking classified information that was produced by government officials.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) has never and will never criticize China or any other country for spying or prosecuting spies.

If Snowden were Chinese, the Chinese government would ban talking about him or anything he uncovered. A [keyword attack](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)) with "Snowden" in the West has no effect.

It is obvious that the level of surveillance in any dictatorship will be infinitely higher, since the Government has much more power and no-one can criticize.

On the West however, the debate Snowden sparked cannot be censored, and has helped to control excessive and secret state power.

Ultimately, Ciro thinks camera surveillance is somewhat inevitable, because people will always want to fight crime and terrorism and surveillance technology keeps getting cheaper and cheaper.

He is however strictly against the ban of cryptography.

He also believes that a good solution to balance out government power is the [Second amendment (美國憲法第二修正案)](#second-amendment-(美國憲法第二修正案)). It is better to have more school shootings and less full-blown dictatorship led genocides / mass human rights violations.

In 2019 China amusingly censored passages Snowden’s "Permanent Record" autobiography book, which Snowden then published on Twitter:

* https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784 ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20191112083232/https://twitter.com/snowden/status/1194092273170038784))

As a [Redditor put it](https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/dv5q8o/china_censors_edward_snowdens_new_book_he/f7axckl/):

> I don’t think they understand that what Snowden stands for is completely the opposite of what the Chinese gov is lol

Snowden then later released the entire Chinese version of the book for free online with the censored parts underlined: https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200213001653/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2020/02/10/snowden_china_censorship)), link to the book: [++https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf++](++https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf++) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20200212144108/https://a.temporaryrecord.com/Permanent_Record_-_CN_edition_with_underlined_redactions.pdf)). One wonders why he didn’t just do that in the first place for all versions, maybe he needed to pay the writer that helped him?

**Snowden highlighted defects on abuses of power in a Western democracy, and the discussion he sparked helped to control such abuses. [To obey is to betray](#to-obey-is-to-betray) comes to mind. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edward_Snowden-2.jpg).**

##### Bad things have been done in the name of freedom (以自由的名义人做过很多坏事)

E.g.: [September 11th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks).

Bad things have been done in the name of anything.

It’s just that [much](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)), [worse](#xinjiang-(新疆)) [things](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)) are done without freedom than with it.

Democracies cannot necessarily protect weak countries from powerful ones either. No political system can do that, because humans are trash essentially.

What democracy do is to protect its own people against its own government. Because when the government turns against part of the population in a dictatorship, that part of the population gets crushed entirely, without any chance to fight, because they don’t have an army or ally countries like other countries do.

Here are some images that [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛))'s like to post:

### Is the Chinese government evil? (中国共产党是邪恶的吗？)

Obviously not, just [inefficient](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) and [dangerous](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)).

It is just another non-democratic empire like the [Qing Dynasty (清朝, 大清, 1636-1912)](#qing-dynasty-(清朝,-大清,-1636-1912)), we might as well cal it:

> 共产朝\
> The Communist Dynasty

Expression previously mentioned at: https://web.archive.org/web/20161025220242/http://tieba.baidu.com/p/752094668

Like any other organization and individual everywhere in the entire world, they are just doing everything that they can to maintain their own power.

It just happens that China’s the current is political system allows the CCP to do really bad things.

And it should also be noted that [it is in part the West’s fault](#henri-meyer) that China currently has this shitty system.

[Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) thinks otherwise of course, they think the CCP is actually made up of real actual devils in some dimension: [Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong?

#### Chinese politicians really care about the Chinese citizens (中国政客真正关心中国公民)

Sometimes people say Ciro Santilli is naive.

Politicians are the same all over the world.

Some might have good intentions, but most don’t give a shit about anyone else.

But all must play a careful political game, and sometimes betray their own beliefs to not lose power entirely.

Even those that genuinely care might have to play such political games.

China’s problem is not its politicians.

It’s the current shitty political organization, which allows/convinces those politicians to do really bad things: [Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China richer? (为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)), [Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China less likely to start a war? (为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)) and [Democracies have less corruption than dictatorships (民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)](#democracies-have-less-corruption-than-dictatorships-(民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)).

Western politicians don’t care about the people either: [Western society is extremely unequal (西方社会极度不平等)](#western-society-is-extremely-unequal-(西方社会极度不平等)). But at least they have to pretend a little.

By John Kenneth Galbraith, possibly based on an earlier [Soviet Union (苏联)](#soviet-union-(苏联)) joke [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ocasio-cortez-capitalism-quote/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ocasio-cortez-capitalism-quote/):

> Under capitalism, man oppresses man. Under socialism, it’s just the opposite.

#### Is Chinese politician X evil? (中国政客X邪恶吗？)

The term evil does not make sense unless you are [religious](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)).

The best definition of evil is a psychopath with zero empathy for anyone: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy although this can be better characterized as a disease or extreme personality trait.

The huge majority of those politicians are just regular dudes with a knack for politics but brought up in a fucked up political situation.

Just like you, Ciro Santilli and other politicians in any country.

### Comparisons between the CCP and Nazi Germany (纳粹德国和中共长得很想)

As of 2020, the [Chinese "Communist" Party (CCP, 中国共产党, 1949-, Cult of Mao/Xi, 毛习邪教, 10.000 year Reich)](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich)) is much more like Nazi Germany than it is like the [Soviet Union (苏联)](#soviet-union-(苏联)).

Both CCP and Nazis share the same basic core ideology: capitalism, [love your country/leader mindlessly](#little-pink-american-dream-vs-chinese-dream), work hard, [throw any dissidents under the bus](#most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship-(中国大众支持他们的独裁)), and [everyone will become richer](#as-long-as-china-is-developing-economically,-it-is-fine-to-violate-the-human-rights-of-a-few-million-people-(只要经济好，我不在乎人权)) (except the dissidents who will be in jail or dead).

Thankfully, the CCP is possibly less bad as of 2020 it has less of "this minority (Jews) is the cause of all our problems/racial supremacy approach". But everything else, and arguably the key points that got most German people on-board in the first place, are so similar, that it has to raise huge red flags.

We must however be careful not to demonize the Nazis, as that is not a helpful way to learn from the past.

The Nazis were also people like us, and that is the scary thing we must never forget, thus we should never fall for:

* [Reductio ad Hitlerum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum)
* [希特勒归谬法](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/希特勒歸謬法)

Notably, it can be argued that the Nazis did bring economic growth and stability to Germany, which the people desperately needed, see also [Goring’s appearance on the Nuremberg trials](#goring-nuremberg).

Keywords:

* Xitler (习特勒). 习 "xi2" is very close in sound to the Chinese name of Hitler: [希特勒](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/阿道夫·希特勒) (xi1 te4 le4)
* Chinazi (赤纳粹 Chi Na Cui). TODO why 赤. Means Red, which is a reference to Communism, although red was of course it was also the color of the original Nazis. But where else is it used? Chi is also chosen to achieve the sound "Chi Na" as a variant of [Shina (zhina, 支那)](#shina-(zhina,-支那))

The article discusses how Nazi Germany propaganda worked, without mention to the CCP, but it was still apparently [banned in China](https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/baitai/20190816/1175647.html).

https://www.southbankresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/01/ZHA-issue-2510-free.pdf has a good quote:
> Would you have stood up to Hitler when he came to power? Or would you have been an appeaser, like Chamberlain? Or perhaps even a supporter of fascism, like the Daily Mail’s owner at the time?
>
> We all like to imagine we’re courageous enough to stand up to tyranny and persecution. That we would have stood up to the villains of the past.

#### Thousand-Year Reich (中华人民共和国万岁)

As mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reich&oldid=1054809270#During_the_Nazi_period a popular way of referring to the Nazi rule was as the:

> Thousand-Year Reich

In China, a popoular expression for "Long Live" is "万岁", which means "live for ten thousand years".

This comes from old Imperial times, but applies perfectly to the Nazi/CCP analogy.

### Contributing guidelines (贡献指南)

#### I want to take my chances and make a shitpost in cirosantilli/china-dictatorship (屎帖子)

So, have you reached the conclusion that your [shitpost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shitposting) is [worth the risk of getting blocked](CONTRIBUTING.md)?

Remember that shitposts can also be creative: if you are going to insult Ciro Santilli, at least do it in a creative way, or else you look like an even bigger idiot than you really are.

A collection of shitposts for you to take inspiration from can be found at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Ashitpost+

Also, when opening a shitpost you may mark it clearly such with the shitpost issue template which automatically assigns the shitpost label. Doing so will make you look like less of an idiot.

While we require polite replies to polite posts, no matter what which side they are defending, if a post is marked as a shitpost, things are much more relaxed and fun, and you can generally get away with telling the OP to fuck themselves [without getting blocked](CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### I am going to write a huge wall of text to prove my point

Feel free to do that, but no one will ever read most of it.

If you want your comment to be read, choose your key point well, and deliver it.

It is a shame that most people who are ever able to do that are [shitposters](#i-want-to-take-my-chances-and-make-a-shitpost-in-cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-(屎帖子)), but credit where credit is due.

#### Can I contact Ciro Santilli in Chinese? (我可以用中文联系三西猴吗？)

If you don’t know English well enough, that’s fine though, go for Chinese, Ciro Santilli will likely understand it: [Does Ciro Santilli speak Chinese? (三西猴会说中文吗？)](#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese?-(三西猴会说中文吗？)).

But if you do, use English.

Ciro is not going to learn Chinese because of your message.

It is more productive for you to write in English, so that the rest of the West can also learn something new.

Especially since it seems that most Chinese already know what you are talking about, so you are better off teaching Western people about it.

##### I am going to use a bunch of Chinese slangs because it makes me feel smart (我知道网络语言，我很聪明)

Obviously, if you want to be understood, use simple and standard Chinese, since as Ciro has already stated clearly, his Chinese sucks: [Does Ciro Santilli speak Chinese? (三西猴会说中文吗？)](#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese?-(三西猴会说中文吗？)).

Avoid slangs, otherwise Ciro might not have patience to Google your useless slangs down [Zhihu](#zhihu-(知乎,-censored-quora-clone,-审查-quora-克隆)) questions.

Of course, if you have to read this, you likely are not going to say anything useful in the first place, so not reading your post is likely fine, just make sure to mark it as a [I want to take my chances and make a shitpost in cirosantilli/china-dictatorship (屎帖子)](#i-want-to-take-my-chances-and-make-a-shitpost-in-cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-(屎帖子)) if you don’t want Ciro to think you are a complete idiot.

Using slangs makes some people feel smart due their advanced knowledge of a specific subculture, or makes them feel part of that subculture to gather allies. I.e., it is a form of [shibboleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth). It mainly comes down to a way of avoiding any rational conversation about China’s obvious problems by highlighting [Non-Chinese people should not interfere in Chinese politics (外国人不应该干预中国政治)](#non-chinese-people-should-not-interfere-in-chinese-politics-(外国人不应该干预中国政治)).

Or maybe they just want to waste Ciro’s time.

Such idiots don’t see however that every major slang is Googleable, and that every overly obscure slang is already not understandable by a large part of the Chinese population, and won’t be understood by anybody in 5 years, so that you are wasting your time writing this gibberish. But since you are an idiot, it’s not like you have anything better to do with your time, so maybe it doesn’t matter.

If you want to efficiently prevent anyone from understanding your stuff, Ciro recommends that you just use SHA-256 instead:

```
$ printf 'heil xi' | sha256sum
286b183bf41d6c9de5315bbd64f1ca35a58157ae2e7f38086978c108e67c4882  -
```

A Chinese insult tip 101, avoid similar sound euphemisms. If you are going to say shit at least grow some balls or tits and use the proper characters, Ciro will respect you more for it:

* 屄 cunt, most often for [傻屄](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/傻屄)
  * 逼
    * "sb"
    * "B": https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/105
    * "BB" TODO https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/37819380.html
* 肏 fuck: 操
* 傻 idiot: 沙
* 屌 dick: 屌

Places to try and decrypt Internet slang when you feel like wasting your time:

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中国大陆网络用语列表
  * "网络用语" is the most common word for "Internet Slang", so also useful for Google searches
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Internet_slang

Random slangs of interest and related concepts:

* [火星文](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/火星文) ([Martian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martian_language)). This figures for example in the language rules of the [PTT Bulletin Board System (Taiwanese message board, 批踢踢實業坊)](#ptt-bulletin-board-system-(taiwanese-message-board,-批踢踢實業坊)) joke board: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602005687.A.E4D.html (禁止使用簡體字、注音文、火星文、外國語言或其他無法直觀理解之內容作為文章主體).

Some useful slangs seen on the wild:

* 敏感瓷: 敏感词 sensitive words, phonetic approximation
* "emm" https://www.zhihu.com/question/288002941
* 猎狗: lit. hunting dog. Metaphorically: lackey, a servent of someone else, usually evil. Usually as in: [Is Ciro Santilli's china-dictatorship campaign funded or otherwise supported by some organization? 谁收买三西猴散布关于中国的谣言？](#is-ciro-santilli's-china-dictatorship-campaign-funded-or-otherwise-supported-by-some-organization?-谁收买三西猴散布关于中国的谣言？), e.g. 国的狗 [https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/914](https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/914). This sense is mentioned e.g. at [http://cidian.118cha.com/1872420.html](http://cidian.118cha.com/1872420.html) which includes two 20th century usage examples.

###### Ruhua (to disgrace china, 辱华, 乳华)

Basically a 2 character slang for [Hurt the feelings of the Chinese people (伤害中国人民的感情)](#hurt-the-feelings-of-the-chinese-people-(伤害中国人民的感情)) which cool people in the web use:

* https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75717383 天天辱华，辱华的到底是谁？ on [Zhihu (知乎, censored Quora clone, 审查 Quora 克隆)](#zhihu-(知乎,-censored-quora-clone,-审查-quora-克隆))

* https://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese-news-46314935 on [BBC (英国广播公司, British government media)](#bbc-(英国广播公司,-british-government-media))

The pardox is: as soon as you start talking about ruhua, you start to risk getting banned in China, because most of ruhua is banned in China itself.

In this project for example: https://github.com/leiroc/insults the author is aiming to create a list of such insults. So someone came and suggested adding this project to the list at: [https://github.com/leiroc/insults/issues/4](https://github.com/leiroc/insults/issues/4), which is obviouly censored in China, as an example. They even have an [ICP license 非经营性网站备案 (2000)](#icp-license-非经营性网站备案-(2000)) at [https://insults.cn/](https://insults.cn/), isn’t that cute?

To which the repo owner replied:

> 感谢提交，这个人有点疯狂了。我就不给加到记录里面了，因为加进去，看到的人就会更加多。对于这些信息不是所有人都有分别真伪的能力。害怕有些人信了他的，或者被他诱导。所以还是让他消声少曝光的好，这些人国家肯定一直在监控的，我们可以放心。

Google Translate:

> Thanks for submitting, this person is a bit crazy. I won’t add it to the record, because if you add it, you will see more people. Not everyone has the ability to distinguish between authenticity and falsehood for this information. I’m afraid that some people will believe him or be induced by him. Therefore, it is better to silence him and reduce exposure. These people and countries must have been monitoring them, so we can rest assured.

This perfecly shows the ruhua paradox. In the end, you are only allowed to talk about the most idiotic and insipid events, while censoring any serious self criticism.

### Personal questions about Ciro Santilli (关于三西猴的问题)

#### Has Ciro Santilli you ever lived in China? (三西猴住过中国吗？)

Not as of 2019, he has only visited once in 2012, and it was [amazingly beautiful](#does-ciro-santilli-hate-china?-(三西猴讨厌中国吗？)).

**Ciro Santilli with a stone carved [Budai (布袋和尚)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai) in the [Feilai Feng caves (飞来峰)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Maitreya_and_disciples_carving_in_Feilai_Feng_Caves.jpg) near the [Lingyin Temple (灵隐寺)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingyin_Temple) in Hangzhou taken during his legendary 2012 touristic trip to China. Will he ever be able to go to China again to re-experience such marvelous locations? If the CCP falls before he dies, and if the statue hasn’t been destroyed by the commies, Ciro will return to that exact spot and take a second picture. How will he look like?**

![height=500](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Ciro_Santilli_with_a_stone_carved_Budai_in_the_Feilai_Feng_caves_near_the_Lingyin_Temple_in_Hangzhou_in_2012.jpg)

But he doesn’t think it is a good idea for him to do that now, in case his Visa got accepted, because he is not interested in learning about the Chinese jail system! :-)

He knows that if you don’t mind contributing to making [WW3](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)) deadlier and shut up and obey the CCP, China is already a fine place to live as much as any other developing country.

##### Would Ciro Santilli like to live in China? (三西猴想住在中国吗？)

If the dictatorship ends, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) would like to [migrate to China](#does-ciro-santilli-hate-china?-(三西猴讨厌中国吗？)) if given a decent job to help China develop and become awesomer.

Before the Dictatorship, Ciro likely won’t be able to enter/it wouldn’t be a good idea: [Would Ciro Santilli be able to visit China before the CCP ends? (三西猴能否在中共结束之前访问中国？)](#would-ciro-santilli-be-able-to-visit-china-before-the-ccp-ends?-(三西猴能否在中共结束之前访问中国？)).

And it is immoral to help make dictatorships richer by working for their companies: [What should Western countries do about China? (西方国家应该怎么对待中国？)](#what-should-western-countries-do-about-china?-(西方国家应该怎么对待中国？)).

##### Would Ciro Santilli be able to visit China before the CCP ends? (三西猴能否在中共结束之前访问中国？)

It would be interesting to apply for a VISA to find out.

But Ciro won’t do it because it is too risky that it would be a waste of Ciro’s precious [time and money](#doesn't-ciro-santilli-have-anything-better-to-do-than-pissing-off-china?-(除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)).

Firstly, [Jamal Khashoggi](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-45812399) taught us that walking into enemy into consulates of enemy countries is a bad idea.

Then, even if the VISA were accepted, Ciro could still be turned back on entering the country, thus wasting the flight time and money. This could either be a genius plot to waste the money of enemies of the state, or due to a crappy divided IT system between the border control and the VISA people.

Finally, even after the border, there is still the possibility that Ciro could be stopped in the country half-way through the visit and sent back, or be interrogated for a few days, or less likely murdered with poison.

Therefore, if you think that living in China is fundamental to understand it, please just explain what you think one can learn from the experience instead. Do you really need to live there to see its censorship machine working? It would arguably be harder to see it from the inside.

#### Is Ciro Santilli Chinese? (三西猴是中国人吗？)

See: https://cirosantilli.com/ciro-santilli

It makes [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) smile when [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) consider he might be Chinese.

Does "[Ciro Santilli](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))" sound like a Chinese name?

Would a Chinese person write this tutorial primarly in English?

Would a Chinese person [speak such obviously shit Chinese](#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese?-(三西猴会说中文吗？))?

Think, wumao, think!!!

And it does not matter: [Non-Chinese people should not interfere in Chinese politics (外国人不应该干预中国政治)](#non-chinese-people-should-not-interfere-in-chinese-politics-(外国人不应该干预中国政治)).

But [his wife is](#why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much?-(为什么三西猴喜欢中国那么多？)).

#### Does Ciro Santilli speak Chinese? (三西猴会说中文吗？)

As of 2019, oral enough for daily things, but not understand most natural casual dinner conversation or watch TV series, because they go too quickly into vocabulary subject areas that he doesn’t know. And obviously, using [slangs](#i-am-going-to-use-a-bunch-of-chinese-slangs-because-it-makes-me-feel-smart-(我知道网络语言，我很聪明)) just makes things really hard.

When it matters, and with some patience, he can make himself understood though with [some analogies](https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/) ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190908144612/https://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/)) and a dictionary.

From the HSK vocabulary list, he estimates that he is definitely HSK 3, but not quite HSK 4. This would likely equate A2/B1 in the [European system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages).

Phonetics wise, Ciro can’t distinguish or produce a few sounds, notably `-ing` vs `-in` and his off-tone rate is high, but it tends to not matter at all compared to his lack of vocabulary. Except for his [mother-in-law](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)), who sometimes does not understand it at all without correct tones!

Ciro reads with [https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen](https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen) after [Perapera](https://www.perapera.org/) died when he wants to learn new words/has patience/something is very important, and can basically understand everything in that way. TODO perapera support stopped in 2021: https://www.perapera.org/plugins/ and since browsers don’t have stable API’s it very quickly stopped working for everyone. Alternatives asked at: https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/78268/on-mouse-hover-pop-up-chinese-dictionary-browser-extension-alternative-to-perape/ [Zhongwen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zhongwen-chinese-english/kkmlkkjojmombglmlpbpapmhcaljjkde) worked, source at https://github.com/cschiller/zhongwen

When he has no patience or for larger not very important chunks of text though, he reads with Google Translate as it tends to work, and then if there is an important sentence that was translated to garbage with Perapera.

Ciro writes with a mixture of [Pleco](https://www.pleco.com/), Google translate and Googling to see if Chinese actually say the sentences that way, never Google translate alone as it would be too imprecise.

Ciro really wishes he could learn more Chinese. Ciro really loves the Chinese language. But he has other more important endeavors at the moment. There simply aren’t enough hours in a day.

Spoken Chinese is in Ciro’s opinion a relatively easy language to learn from scratch, because word formation is so often logical:, e.g.:

* volcano = fire + mountain: 火山(huo shan)
* train = fire + car: 火车 (huo che), a reference to old [steam locomotives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_locomotive)

and there is no useless crap like [verb grammatical conjugation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_conjugation), [grammatical gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_gender), [plural inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural), capitalization, etc. ([latino sine flexione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latino_sine_flexione) anyone?)

Ciro [hasn’t tried to learn characters](#characters-(汉字)) because [too much effort](#chinese-characters-are-insane-(汉字是疯狂的)), but he did learn some of the most common ones without trying.

Ciro initially learnt from book that come with audio recordings in the first 6-months to 1 year in 2010, but that got impossibly boring afterward, so he later moved to just basically talking as much as possible non-important things to [his wife in Chinese](#why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much?-(为什么三西猴喜欢中国那么多？)), and whenever he reaches one that he doesn’t know that seems useful, he Plecos it up or just 怎么说 to his [Ciro Santilli's wife (三西猴的老婆)](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)) and then Pleco.

It should also be mentioned that Ciro also feels that it would be better if all countries more officially adopted English as an international language that everyone should learn for reasons explained at: https://cirosantilli.com/having-more-than-one-natural-language-is-bad-for-the-world

##### Chinese characters are insane (汉字是疯狂的)

Maybe the [commies](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich)) for once [did something good](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) by introducing [simplified Chinese characters (简化字)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters)?

But they should have gone further and reduced it to pinyin like the Korean and Vietnamese did, this will make your culture much easier to export.

No foreign adult will every learn to read and write Chinese unless they are completely obsessed by the culture or need it as part of their jobs. And even then, they will avoid it at all costs, because life is just too short!

Japanese [furigana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana) also comes to mind. The characters are so insane that you need to a well specified and widely used phonetic reading aid, especially for teenagers, but likely not only in case of rarer characters! There’s even an HTML tag for that for God’s sake: [the HTML Ruby tag](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#the-ruby-element).

Yes, ideograms are:

* [beautiful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy)
* [maybe you can read faster](https://chinese.stackexchange.com/questions/2003/can-chinese-readers-scan-large-amounts-of-text-faster-more-accurately-than-their)
* [vertical text (纵排)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts) is beautiful.
  * the top to bottom aspect is obviously due to the binding of [bamboo and wooden slips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_and_wooden_slips) ([简牍](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/简牍))
  * TODO but why right to left? Left to right makes more sense as you don’t put your hand on top of the most recent ink: https://www.quora.com/Why-are-Chinese-characters-individually-written-from-left-to-right-yet-in-ancient-times-sentences-of-Chinese-characters-were-written-and-read-from-right-to-left
  * but is it more efficient? [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/question/22104723), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Can-literate-Chinese-people-easily-read-vertical-writing)).
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_and_vertical_writing_in_East_Asian_scripts#Right-to-left_horizontal_writing also clarifies that traditional shop signs are also right to left, and it is just a sub-case of the usual right to left script, but with a single row
* more historically stable, and you can still read/learn more or less quickly to read [texts written more than two thousand years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Chinese_language)
* it takes up way less horizontal space as Ciro noticed while adding bilingual captions to some of the images under https://gitlab.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media see e.g.: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-media/master/Xidan_Wall.jpg
  * on the other hand, you have to use slightly larger fonts for Chinese, because the characters are so dense that if they are not tall enough they become unreadable. Still, the area is much smaller without a doubt.
* single character emoticons like "[囧](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiong)", before the [Emoticons Unicode block](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticons_(Unicode_block))! Yes, when your language has a character so useless that it becomes an emoticon, maybe you should start to worry that something went wrong somewhere... See also [tank-man-emoticon](#tank-man-emoticon).

but they just take too much time for any sane person adult to learn, it’s harder than {cpp}!

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) smirked when he came across the character "蒄" in Pleco, and the translation was: "meaning unknown (herb mentioned in old books)". Yes, at the word level, the same like exists in phonetic systems, but that it takes up a modern dictionary and Unicode slot is still funny.

He also smiles very broadly whenever [his wife](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)) finds a character she doesn’t remember. Or when she spends 20 seconds tabbing to find the correct character for some Proper name she wants to type in pinyin. It feels good to be right.

#### Is Ciro Santilli a radical? (三西猴是激进分子吗？)

Saying that someone is a radical is useless [Ad hominem (訴諸人身)](#ad-hominem-(訴諸人身)).

If you want to say something useful, give specific reasons why you think one specific thing that [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) said is incorrect.

Do you consider him a radical because it is unthinkable that China is not perfect?

Or just because he’s trying to [take down](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)) some more websites that your dictatorship still does not dislike enough to block: [China is fine as it is, stop making it worse (中国很好，别让它变得更糟)](#china-is-fine-as-it-is,-stop-making-it-worse-(中国很好，别让它变得更糟))?

Don’t you think that it is much more radical to [be put in jail for your beliefs](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族)) and [silenced if you disagree with anything the government says](#censorship-(审查))?

Ciro doesn’t think either China or West is perfect: [Western media has exaggerated reports on Falun Gong for propaganda reasons (西方媒体以宣传为由夸大法轮功报道)](#western-media-has-exaggerated-reports-on-falun-gong-for-propaganda-reasons-(西方媒体以宣传为由夸大法轮功报道)).

He’s just listing arguments why he thinks democracy is better, e.g.: [Why would democracy and freedom of speech make China richer?

SJW: there is a seed of SJW in [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)).

One major difference between Ciro and the stereotypical SJW is that he never engage in lengthy discussions as per [Ciro Santilli's reply policy (三西猴的回答政策)](#ciro-santilli's-reply-policy-(三西猴的回答政策)).

He limits himself to listening as much as he can to learn new arguments.

#### Does Ciro Santilli hate China? (三西猴讨厌中国吗？)

On the contrary. China has his favorite:

* [language](#does-ciro-santilli-speak-chinese?-(三西猴会说中文吗？))
* [Chinese Music (中国音乐)](#chinese-music-(中国音乐))
* history
* nature
* culture, notably:
  * intense respect for older people. Whenever Ciro was with his [mother-in-law](#ciro-santilli's-post-when-his-mother-in-law-was-put-into-jail-for-doing-falun-gong-(岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)) and asked for help from young Chinese people, they were extremely nice.

    It is hard to understand how the same people have not managed to speak up when [70 million old ladies were put into jail when Falun Gong was banned](#falun-gong-does-not-have-proof-of-their-persecution-claims-(法轮功没有被迫害的证据)). Only the extreme fear of also going to jail could explain it. Living in China is living in constant fear if you can think for yourself.
  * enormous importance given to education. One must not forget however: grades are useless, and all that matters is how much you improve society

And because of that: [Would Ciro Santilli like to live in China? (三西猴想住在中国吗？)](#would-ciro-santilli-like-to-live-in-china?-(三西猴想住在中国吗？)).

It is interesting how different people get [different impressions](#does-ciro-santilli-hate-china?-(三西猴讨厌中国吗？))!

Of course, the fact that his wife is Chinese and [does Falun Gong](#does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-just-because-his-wife-and-mother-in-law-do-it?-(三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)) may or may not have played a role in it :-)

It was like this: Ciro started getting interested in Chinese culture, then he started hanging out with Chinese people, and then he started hanging out with his wife!

So yes, it is a chicken and egg type of thing. The fact that she is one of the most intelligent, morally upright, cute, and "never give up" person I know may have helped me choose too.

<span id="cia-funding">

##### Is Ciro Santilli's china-dictatorship campaign funded or otherwise supported by some organization? 谁收买三西猴散布关于中国的谣言？

Sure, the CIA sends [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) 10 thousand USD checks from time to time, but that doesn’t change at all what he would be doing.

And sometimes the NSA, FBI, MI6, MI5, Mossad, Al-Qaeda and ISIS also pitch in a bit depending on their needs.

https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/labels/funded-by-cia-argument

Just kidding.

A shady supporting organization might require that he does not disclose their support, so maybe the best answer is that you will never know for sure.

Of course, a hidden support would represent a reputation hit for both such organizations and for Ciro, which makes it less likely that I would have accepted or had such an offer.

Also consider Ciro’s motivation. If your [mother in law were put into jail unfairly for 15 days](#ciro-santilli's-post-when-his-mother-in-law-was-put-into-jail-for-doing-falun-gong-(岳母因修炼法轮功入狱时的帖子)), for following the same religion that [your wife follows](#does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-just-because-his-wife-and-mother-in-law-do-it?-(三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)), and if you had a social media presence, wouldn’t you be tempted to do the same?

What about you, are you funded by the CCP?

The fact that Ciro Santilli is obviously a real full time software engineer based on his open source contributions, and so does not need government funding, is perhaps the single greatest advantage of not having carried this campaign anonymously:

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/cirosantilli/
* https://stackoverflow.com/users/895245

It’s nothing world breaking, but it is at a level where it simply cannot be faked.

##### Does your employer support this project? (你的雇主支持此项目吗？)

My employer has nothing to do with this.

He doesn’t approve or disapprove of the Chinese government or of my private actions.

The only thing that my employer _does_ believe in is that employees can have their own political opinions, and that this should not affect hiring decisions.

Obviously, this action limits my ability to lead high profile deals with China.

Also I’m quite curious if this would limit my ability to go to China for business, but I haven’t applied for a visa since I’ve started this. It likely wouldn’t be a good idea for me to go to China :-)

But my employer believes that inclusion and non-discrimination are more valuable.

I will always do my best to not let my personal opinions affect my professional decisions, as that would be unfair to my employer.

#### Doesn't Ciro Santilli have anything better to do than pissing off China? (除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)

In 1989, besides [Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 (六四事件)](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)) and [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))'s birth, a beautiful thing called the World Wide Web was invented!

The Internet gives everyone the magic power of writing something, and having million people read it for free!

This is how much time Ciro spends on this project to give you an idea:

* every day or two, some wumao or anti-CCP person sends a message, to which Ciro replies, and sometimes does an update
* Ciro used to check https://www.reddit.com/r/China daily amongst many other programming subs, and all major bad news show up there. See also: [Anti-CCP information sources (反中共信息来源)](#anti-ccp-information-sources-(反中共信息来源)). But he stopped in 2022, even that was not worth the time.
* when something bad enough comes up, Ciro might spend some time updating [his keyword attack](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)). He used to check https://chinadigitaltimes.net/china/sensitive-words-series/ by [China Digital Times (CDT, 中国数字时代, USA government media)](#china-digital-times-(cdt,-中国数字时代,-usa-government-media)), to help, but hasn’t needed mor recently. He’s only been updating it on Stack Overflow and GitHub attacks these days.

Then Ciro just contributes to programming websites exactly as he would if he weren’t making this campaign, and voila.

What has happened more and more is that Ciro has been expanding resources by short burst rather than continuously. This began especially at the end of 2019 and start of 2020 was such as hot year with [2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests (反对逃犯条例修订草案运动)](#2019-hong-kong-anti-extradition-bill-protests-(反对逃犯条例修订草案运动)) and [Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)).

But Ciro only works on this when his brain was too tired of technical stuff and unable to do more, or as a brain warm up routine in the morning. So it doesn’t take any work time away from him.

Telling the CCP to fuck off is surprisingly relaxing, you should try it some time too. It uses a different part of your brain other than the programming one. It is, one could say, an art form.

#### Is Ciro Santilli against Communism/Socialism in general or just against the Chinese Communist Party specifically? Ciro Santilli 是普遍反对共产主义/社会主义还是专门反对中国共产党？

Anti-dictatorship and censorship, not anti-communist in general. In [this project](#github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship), [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) has sometimes used the word "communist/commie" loosely as a shortcut for "supporter of the CCP", but it does not extend by default to communism in general.

Most importantly, China is far from being socialist or communist. It is just a dictatorship with savage capitalism. Exactly like [Nazi Germany](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)).

It is true that the CCP takes greater control of corporations, as shown e.g. in the [Tech Crackdown of 2021](#xi-jinping-tech-crachdown-2021), which is also something Ciro Santilli has asked for in the West, see also: https://cirosantilli.com/governments-have-lost-all-power-to-companies

But to call it communist or socialist is a joke. There are no big specific benefits to citizens that are not already present in capitalist countries. It is nothing like the Soviet Union, where people had actual job guarantees, and everything provieded for (in theory).

And Ciro has a fundamental and irrational belief that we should not [violate human rights to reach those goals](#as-long-as-china-is-developing-economically,-it-is-fine-to-violate-the-human-rights-of-a-few-million-people-(只要经济好，我不在乎人权)), which is why he opposes the CCP (and others who violate human rights).

Also, being in a dictatorship is very risky business, see: [Most Chinese people don't care about the minorities (大多数中国人不关心少数民族)](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族)), [Dictatorships have greater development variability (专政具有更大的发展可变性)](#dictatorships-have-greater-development-variability-(专政具有更大的发展可变性)).

And there are [concrete advantages to dictatorships](#i-like-my-dictatorship-(我喜欢我的独裁统治)).

Classify Ciro’s techno-political goals as you will:

* endgame: https://cirosantilli.com/unconditional-basic-income
* very conservative and clearly sustainable neargame: https://cirosantilli.com/free-gifted-education

A possible way to get closer to either: https://cirosantilli.com/electronic-voting

Anything in between however, he’s not sure about.

### People in China have already considered democracy, and rejected it (中国人已经考虑要不要民主, 到底决定不要了)

OK, shall we put that to an anonymous vote just to make sure?

Dear sir or madam: do you want more control over your government? y/n

Oops, I forgot that [proposing such a vote would put in you jail](#most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship-(中国大众支持他们的独裁)), never mind.

### Would it be right to use violence to overthrow the CCP? (用暴力推翻中共正确吗？)

In an ideal world, Ciro Santilli is of course "against violence".

But what if you could prevent a lot of future violence with some violence today?

Ah, the eternal question which only God can answer:

* https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-quote-The-end-justifies-the-means "What is the origin of the quote 'The end justifies the means?'"

  * [Trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)
* [Nonviolent-resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance)

Do you really think that the communists will step down if you ask them nicely enough? Even after [Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 (六四事件)](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件))?

A quote from [V for Vendetta (2005)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_(film)) comes to mind:

> Q: If they do, what do you think will happen [the people protest against their Government]?
>
> A: What usually happens when people [without guns](#second-amendment-(美國憲法第二修正案)) stand up to people with guns.

video::TcoBv6ibh8M[youtube,height=400,width=600]

How do you think the CCP or any other party got into power and maintained that power in the first place? Obviously [through violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Revolution). And likely due to earlier [Japanese invasions which weakened the Guomindang](#non-chinese-people-should-not-interfere-in-chinese-politics-(外国人不应该干预中国政治)).

And the CCP actually uses "the ends justify the means" as an argument to justify its own actions: [As long as China is developing economically, it is fine to violate the human rights of a few million people (只要经济好，我不在乎人权)](#as-long-as-china-is-developing-economically,-it-is-fine-to-violate-the-human-rights-of-a-few-million-people-(只要经济好，我不在乎人权)).

The question of if anything is morally right or wrong makes no sense. All that matters is: what is the government that maximizes the happines of its own people, and who has the power to do what? [Getting richer,](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) is part of the equation, but so is [not being constantly affraid that you will be randomly put in jail for no good reason](#rule-of-law-(法治)).

TODO origin?

### Why does Ciro Santilli say that China is a dictatorship? (中国不是独裁！)

Ciro is using the word in an slightly extended/joking sense.

Maybe "authoritarian" is a more precise term, but it is just too much of a mouthful.

In particular, dictatorships are harder to sustain than authoritarianism, since it generally implies even less freedom, and a single leader whose death can destabilize everything.

The CCP is more like a social class with a large number of members and various sub-layers, and it is therefore much harder to take down on the other hand.

Dictatorship is becoming [more and more precise under Xi](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-party-term-limit.html) however.

Even [Mao Zedong (毛泽东, 1954–1976)](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976)) admits it and put it into the constitution: [People’s democratic dictatorship 人民民主专政](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_democratic_dictatorship), so funny.

Well known [Evil Western media](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)) that also call China a dictatorship:

##### How does Ciro Santilli choose keywords for the keyword attack? (三西猴如何为关键词攻击选择关键词？)

I haven’t counted, but the limit for Stack Overflow is quite low, and I’m always almost at the maximum, which is about "Ciro Santilli" + 3 3-4 Chinese character events with a separator.

These are some of my prioritization guidelines:

* recent cases receive a large prime over the raw death toll, because older cases can always be attributed to other people.

  E.g., I’ve heard there is even some opening towards acknowledging the Great Famine, thus 烏坎事件 (and others from my previous profile names)
* words must refer to a precise event, and must be clearly summarizable in very few chars, for increased impact, and profile name length limitations.

  E.g. "High [corruption](#democracies-have-less-corruption-than-dictatorships-(民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)) rates, high pollution", although very serious, feel too generic.
* events that relate directly to freedom of speech receive a prime, since they can only happen in China and very few other countries.

  E.g.: [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)), [Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 (六四事件)](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)).

  Non e.g.: corruption and pollution. Those are hard to quantify, and there is always an immediate reply: china GDP per capita is low, same happens in India, Brazil, etc.

  Freedom of speech however, is immediately verifiable (e.g. "my [Weibo](#weibo-(新浪微博)) was taken down"), and undeniably caused by the current central government.
* the more people affected, and the more deeply they have been affected, the more important obviously

I am currently trying to maintain in my Stack Overflow Location a ranking of events in a single string, so that it can be easily copy pasted around. The location appears on every page if you hover over my account name, so it is likely in the HTML at least.

If you think that this list can be improved, please open an issue explaining how and why.

Note: 没有希望。 would likely more accurately be translated as "I have no hopes for school". But the same sentence also means "I have no hope", and it was too tempting to recast it in terms of the Lie Flat movement.

#### Photobombing-like attacks

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photobombing

Explicitly forbidden in China by the law: [Real username law (2015)](#real-username-law-(2015)).

##### Appropriation attack

An appropriation attack is one where the attackers attempt to associate an existing symbol to their cause.

For example during the [2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests (反对逃犯条例修订草案运动)](#2019-hong-kong-anti-extradition-bill-protests-(反对逃犯条例修订草案运动)) attackers attempted to use this technique to associate a generic [Chinese Chun-Li-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chun-Li) character Mei from Blizzard’s [Overwatch game](++https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)++) to try and get it blocked in China after the gaming company punished a pro gamer for defending the Hong Kong protests.

##### Sport event live broadcast image attacks (体育赛事直播图片攻击)

#### What should Western countries do about China? (西方国家应该怎么对待中国？)

Force all their Western servers to accept [TLS 1.3 ENSI](#tls-1.3-ensi) connections only: [TLS 1.3 ENSI](#tls-1.3-ensi).

Western governments must reciprocate unfair Chinese practices: https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/18508/why-dont-western-countries-penalize-chinese-companies-in-the-same-way-that-chin

Companies only care about money and have no long term view, the following must be imposed by governments on Western companies.

Serious sanctions must be pot on companies that sell sensitive things to dictatorships:

* [censorship or anti-privacy software](#western-companies-that-sell-censorship-technology-to-dictatorships-(向独裁政权出售审查技术的西方公司))

Related approaches taken by the CCP that should also be stopped dead by strict enforcement of the [Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Agents_Registration_Act):

* [Chinese interference in Western media (中国干预西方媒体)](#chinese-interference-in-western-media-(中国干预西方媒体)), notably [China watch (2011-)](#china-watch-(2011-)), must 
* [CCP apologists (中共辩护士)](#ccp-apologists-(中共辩护士))

Physical presence influence must be completely blocked, e.g. cultural centers that report directly to the CCP such as [Confucius institute (孔子学院)](#confucius-institute-(孔子学院)) and [Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA, 中国学生学者联合会)](#chinese-students-and-scholars-association-(cssa,-中国学生学者联合会)) must be banned.

News about Chinese state media using Western social media:

* 2016 https://qz.com/671211/chinas-propaganda-outlets-have-leaped-the-top-of-facebook-even-though-it-banned-at-home/ "China’s propaganda news outlets are absolutely crushing it on Facebook"

Accounts that are not labelled as being from the Chinese government, but which support the CCP, must be investigated to determine if they are actually funded by the Chinese government.

TODO what to do with websites of: [Chinese government media (中国政府媒体)](#chinese-government-media-(中国政府媒体))? Blocking them has the downsides that:

* it would be harder to monitor what crazy shit the commies are doing
* those censorship mechanisms could be reused to block good websites by Western governments that are becoming Evil

Let’s just leave them up to start with, who gives a fuck about them? :-) If they are getting too many page views, we can make search engines add the disclaimer too.

Chinese social media such as [WeChat (微信, Weixin)](#wechat-(微信,-weixin)) and [TikTok (Douyin, 抖音)](#tiktok-(douyin,-抖音)) must be banned. This is less serious than regular websites, because you can always repost on Western social media but without getting spied on:

* 2020-08-07 https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-wechat-executive-order-014615752.html "Trump executive order seeks to ban [TikTok](#tiktok-(douyin,-抖音)), [WeChat (微信, Weixin)](#wechat-(微信,-weixin)) 'transactions' in 45 days"

Whenever China kicks out a western journalist who is in China and reports there, the Western country must do the same and kick out a Chinese journalists for a Chinese media.

An upside of restricting Chinese servies is that it would hugely bolster [Censorship circumvention (翻墙, 科学上网)](#censorship-circumvention-(翻墙,-科学上网)) technologies, as every Chinese expat would need to buy a VPN.

* https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/18508/why-dont-western-countries-penalize-chinese-companies-in-the-same-way-that-chin

Western governments must identify raw material dependencies on China, and reduce them, while at the same time forbidding technology transfer to China. China has been trading cheap resources for technology, and we must stop that now.

Unfair Chinese commercial practices must be reciprocated. Chinese companies should be forced to open joint ventures to operate outside of China, which is a trick China uses to control profits and more easily steal IP from Western companies:

Sanctions must be imposed directly on Chinese officials. They must not be allowed to "escape to a better life or have investments in the West":

* 2020-08-08 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53699084 "Hong Kong: US imposes sanctions on chief executive Carrie Lam"

##### Mark government controlled social media (将政府控制的社交媒体帐户标记为此类)

All posts of all state-sponsored social media accounts must be clearly marked as such.

This should be done not only for China, but of all countries, including Western democracies.

Even better, they should add funny censored images on top of those that are from dictatorship countries.

Furthermore, marked media from dictatorships must be forbidden to both monetize and pay to promote its content.

Any outlets that do not announce themselves as state sponsored but are, must be banned forever when they are found out.

What to do about personal accounts is much harder to decide however, and especially so in the case of [CCP apologists (中共辩护士)](#ccp-apologists-(中共辩护士)), where they might really not be state sponsored, and the creator’s nationality won’t help make the decision either.

Some websites have started marking such accounts, which is a great start.

##### China spy stories (中国间谍故事)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_intelligence_activity_abroad

Do not underestimate the CCP and its control over every Chinese companies and people. Every Chinese company and person is a potential spy.

This is [true for all countries however](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)), and [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) does not not reproach China specifically for its secret service, e.g. [Snowden (斯诺登)](#snowden-(斯诺登)) used [Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#NSA_sub-contractee_as_an_employee_for_Dell) as an NSA front-end.

> 活跃游戏

which means something like "lively games".

Around 2010-2012 about 20 CIA spies in China were killed. One was shot right in the courtyard of a government building as a message to others.

After identifying some of the websites, possibly with a double agent, Iran was able to reach the rest through Google searches for similar sites.

The trouble started in when the CIA was investigating nuclear weapons in Iran in 2009.

The fact that China soon followed could indicate that Iran sold the secret to China.

TODO do we have any such sample websites or screenshots of them? https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/167

Iranians who initially thought they were responding to legitimate opportunities would end up meeting with CIA officers in places like Dubai or Istanbul for recruitment, according to the broadcast.

The Chinese army, and also one of the central intelligence agencies, notably on cyberattacks.

As highlighted on [The Gate of Heavenly Peace (1995, 天安门纪录片)](#the-gate-of-heavenly-peace-(1995,-天安门纪录片)) 1:41, the PLA were really thought of as heroes of the people, partly due to Mao-era propaganda, as their name indicates. But when they stepped into Tiananmen, some of that was lost.

##### What should Western media do about China? (西方媒体应该怎么对待中国？)

When you report something about a person, for fuck’s sake include the person’s name in the title of the article, at the very least the pinyin.

Then, in the body, also add the corresponding Chinese characters on the first mention. This is how you do it: "San Xihou (三西猴)"

Yes, Chinese people also have names. And yes, pinyin has infinitely more homonyms than characters.

In the body of the article, notably in photos, include the exact location of the event if applicable.

City at the very least, but if recognizable, where withing the city.

Yes, China is big! There are many different places in China.

#### Western companies that comply with Chinese censorship requests (遵守中国审查要求的西方公司)

Western governments should prevent companies from complying to Chinese censorship requests, or at least impose fines and sanctions on them.

Citizens should boycott such companies and require them to be punished.

> Hi Ciro,
>
> Your LinkedIn profile is an integral part of how you present your professional self to the world. That’s why we believe it’s important to inform you that due to the presence of prohibited content located in the headline, background image and volunteer experience sections of your LinkedIn profile, your profile and your public activity, such as your comments and items you share with your network, will not be made viewable in China. Your profile and activity continues to remain viewable throughout the rest of the countries in which LinkedIn is available. We will work with you to minimize the impact and can review your profile’s accessibility within China if you update the headline, background image and volunteer experience sections of your profile. But the decision whether to update your profile is yours.
>
> In February 2014, we began offering a localized version of LinkedIn in China. We believe that people everywhere can benefit from Chinese individuals connecting with each other and LinkedIn members in other parts of the world, and that the creation of economic opportunity can have a profound impact on their lives and the lives of their families and communities.
>
> While we strongly support freedom of expression, we recognized when we launched that we would need to adhere to the requirements of the Chinese government in order to operate in China. As a reminder, your profile will remain viewable throughout the rest of the countries in which LinkedIn is available. 
>
> If you have any questions, please contact Customer Service.

  > LinkedIn is cutting 716 jobs and will begin phasing out its local jobs app in China. In a letter today, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslanky said the decision to shutter the standalone China app, called InCareer, was because of “fierce competition and a challenging macroeconomic climate.”
  >
  >
  > InCareer was launched in December 2021, a couple months after LinkedIn announced it was shutting down its main service in China. At that time, it attributed the decision to shutter LinkedIn China to “a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements.”

#### Chinese student coordinator in Germany tells exchange students not to support democracy (2020, 德国学校开班会4反对民主)

YET UNCONFIRMED VIDEO, we have to find who that person is exactly.

The video shows what seems to be Chinese a high school dorm coordinator saying that their Chinese exchange students must stay away from ideas [Democracy (民主)](#democracy-(民主)) and freedom.

And remember that "democracy" and "freedom" are two of the [Core socialist values (社会主义核心价值观)](#core-socialist-values-(社会主义核心价值观))!

### What should pro-democracy Chinese living in China do about the dictatorship? 想要民主住在中国大陆的人应该干什么？

First of all, hide and stay safe, unless you can deal the final blow. From [World at war, 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_at_War), ep. 16:

> A dictatorship is like a snake. If you put your foot on its tail as you do it, it will just bite you and nobody will be helped. You have to strike the head.\
> 独裁就像一条蛇。 如果你在这样做的时候把脚放在它的尾巴上，它只会咬你，没有人会得到帮助。 你必须击打头部。

Once that is taken care of, a few good options are:

* hide your thoughts, manipulate your enemies, infiltrate the corporate, political and military power circles, and go up the ladder
* if you are an technological innovator, leave China and come work for the West. Don’t strengthen commie power.

  Alternatively, with technology you could also try the anonymous rebellion route, but the risk of getting caught is significant, leaving the country first is likely a good idea. See also:

  * [Terminus2049 (端点星计划, 2049bbs)](#terminus2049-(端点星计划,-2049bbs))
  * [Programthink (编程随想, Ruan Xiaohuan, 阮晓寰, programmer on GitHub)](#programthink-(编程随想,-ruan-xiaohuan,-阮晓寰,-programmer-on-github))

If you don’t manage to do either of the above, don’t do any technological work. Go work on the fields or washing dishes. Working well for Chinese companies makes the Chinese [Dictatorship](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) stronger and [more deadly](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-less-likely-to-start-a-war?-(为什么民主和言论自由会让中国不太可能发动战争？)). See also: [Embargoes make dictatorships stronger (禁运使独裁更强大)](#embargoes-make-dictatorships-stronger-(禁运使独裁更强大)).

And regardless: remind your kids that the commies are bastards every day.

### Ciro Santilli's reply policy (三西猴的回答政策)

People get kind of passionate sometimes about politics. And some of them might also be just malicious [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)), although it is generally not possible to distinguish between them.

If you are not a wumao, consider this:

* Ciro Santilli is one, and antagonists are millions. It is therefore not possible to reply to all antagonists.
* Ciro has in the past tried to be nice to stupid people, and they gave nasty replies
* all discussion is useless, [only the keyword attack has any chance of having any effect, and even that is slim](#will-the-keyword-attacks-really-help-to-destroy-the-firewall?-(关键字攻击真的有助于破坏防火墙吗？))

In order to not waste too much time on those, Ciro Santilli uses the following strategy.

If the original thread post is not very interesting, try to parse it quickly and reply once, always [linking to the FAQ](#doesn't-ciro-santilli-have-anything-better-to-do-than-pissing-off-china?-(除了反对中共以外，三西猴有没有别的更好的事儿要作吗？)), and then unfollow the thread. This shows that you’re still alive, and takes little effort.

Always quote reply, and always write down the ID of the OP on your reply, because discussions like this lead to a large number of comment and account deletions, which could make your reply not make much sense without the context.

After the link addressing anything that they might have said, add three randomly selected images from this repository to it. This is fundamental because the average [Little pink (小粉紅, 小紅粉, 兔友)](#little-pink-(小粉紅,-小紅粉,-兔友)) does not speak English. Therefore writing is pointless.

Meme images, however, cross the language barrier beautifully. It is even better if they have Chinese captions.

For websites that don’t accept image on comments, we just have to revert to [random-links](random-links) to start with.

Another way to see it is that we are creating a harder to censor [Instagram](#instagram) channel.

You can think of them metaphorically as throwing hand grenades over the [Great Firewall (GFW, 防火长城)](#great-firewall-(gfw,-防火长城)). Ciro strives to add the following elements in the image itself where applicable:

* English explanation
* Chinese explanation
* date
* location

Because the [CCP censors politics](#censorship-(审查)), and the West does not, we can never "lose" a shitargument. Even if the [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) supports his country in a thread, just being in the same thread as the censored material could already be problematic for the wumao, as it is proof that they’ve seen something they should not have seen.

Therefore the only option for them is to run away.

Finally, also try to extract the email of the user from one of their repositories. When successful, Ciro takes a [Wayback Machine (web.archive.org, 网站时光机)](#wayback-machine-(web.archive.org,-网站时光机)) snapshot of the repository as proof of SHA, and then forks it to https://github.com/wumaoland to possibly keep their email safe in case of account deletion. You never know when this information might be useful.

Then, after replying, do your best never to read the inevitable reply again, and above all, never ever reply. An interesting reply never follows from a non-interesting original post. It is hard at first, but you will eventually get the hang of it.

If the user keeps generating notifications, block them as per [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), replying to a single person multiple times is useless.

Never block users for an initial [shitposts](#i-want-to-take-my-chances-and-make-a-shitpost-in-cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-(屎帖子)), just reply with a stupid joke instead. This approach creates more uncertainty and makes you look cooler. It also allows you to identify who the enemy is. Only block if the user is generating multiple notifications.

If a shitpost is made on most other social media except GitHub issues in this repository, e.g. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, immediately block the user on that website if you have the permission to do that, with a canned reply:

> Hi &lt;idiot’s name>, I don’t reply to China issues here, please open an issue at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues instead, cheers.

Note however that this is not possible on idiotic websites like [Quora](#quora) where such comments may be deleted, possibly automatically, who the fuck knows, e.g. as done at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli/comment/143227962 In that case just link to sections of the FAQ, or mute people, or maybe just block all comments on the post to not waste time with new useless notifications.

This is because it is not worth answering anywhere else where the information will be scattered and impossible to find later on, and especially on websites that are already blocked in China. Shitposts on Stack Overflow and other non-blocked websites are encouraged however, as they further help to get the website blocked in China.

For outbursts of activity from Chinese websites, usually programming ([v2ex, hacpai, pincong](#backlinks-to-this-page-(连接到这个网页的网页))), only post the following canned answer and nothing else, because cowards/people who don’t know English from the website might delete your posts, so you shouldn’t waste time there with that shit:

> 大家你好
>
> 在我的GitHub中国FAQ repository我已经回答了好几个关于我常见的问题。
>
> 你们要是在那儿找不到一个回答，请在那个repository开一个issue，我马上就回答。
>
> 我不要再在这个网页评论。

Finally, don’t forget the golden rule from [Proverbs 26:4](https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-4.htm):

> Don’t answer the foolish arguments of fools, or you will become as foolish as they are.

which is now usually seen in the form [of unclear attribution](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/66460/origin-of-do-not-argue-with-idiots):

> Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.

Where basically idiot == someone who creates posts that obviously aren’t teaching you any new useful thing, or that not praising you :-)

Alternatively, there is also the Chinese [chengyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu) version:

> 对牛弹琴

which means:

> Playing the [qin](#chinese-music-(中国音乐)) to a cow.

which means to talk to someone who does not have intellectual conditions of understanding what you are trying to say, bibliography:

#### Asymmetric information warfare (不对称信息战)

This is a term "invented" by [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) to denote the type of [democracy vs dictatorship](#dictatorships-tend-to-work-together-(独裁政权倾向于合作)) propaganda warfare that naturally emerges.

* the [dictatorship](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) has [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)) and legions of possibly non-anonymous supporters. Although most supporters are [actually anonymous anyways](#anonymous-accounts-ban-(2017))
* the anti-censorship democracy has memes, and a few anonymous supporters, due to the [Chilling effect (寒蝉效应)](#chilling-effect-(寒蝉效应))

This concept is a mixture of the concepts of:

* [asymmetric warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare)
* [information warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare)

This phenomena can also be very clearly seen on the differences between the international propaganda of each side:

* the anti-censorship democracy side, e.g. [Radio Free Asia (RFA, 自由亚洲电台, USA government media)](#radio-free-asia-(rfa,-自由亚洲电台,-usa-government-media)), creates "the dictatorship is bad" propaganda that is censored in the dictatorship and targeted at people people in the dictatorship
* the censorship side, e.g. [China Global Television Network (CGTN, 中国环球电视网, CCP media)](#china-global-television-network-(cgtn,-中国环球电视网,-ccp-media)), creates "the dictatorship is good" propaganda that is targeted at people people outside the dictatorship

#### Ciro Santilli censors wumaos, therefore he is no different from the Chinese government (三西猴审查五毛，因此他与中国政府没有什么不同)

Those who support political [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)) deserve to be censored themselves to get a taste of their own medicine.

Also, unlike the Chinese government, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) does never delete messages. Only prevents more bullshit spam from the same users. This is basically an inevitable part of [Asymmetric information warfare (不对称信息战)](#asymmetric-information-warfare-(不对称信息战)).

#### china-dictatorship reply bot

The bot was taken down on September 2024: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/1330 after complaints from wumaos because GitHub forbids action reply on comment even though that was using minimal resources.

Due to the nature of [Asymmetric information warfare (不对称信息战)](#asymmetric-information-warfare-(不对称信息战)), Ciro has created a reply bot based on [GitHub](#github) Actions that does the above automatically, therefore handling 99% of the work, see:

* [action.js](action.js)
* [.github/workflows/issue.yml](.github/workflows/issue.yml)

The bot works beautifully because it makes Ciro not feel the need to reply to every idiot [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) that comes along. Also Ciro can hide like a coward behind the bot by editing the bot’s comment, which is perfect. This reminded Ciro from something that was said in [Better Call Saul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul) S01 E01:

> And they find themselves in a little room with a detective who acts like he’s their best friend.
>
> "Talk to me," he says. "Help me clear this thing up."
>
> "You don’t need a lawyer, only guilty people need lawyers."
>
> And, boom, hey, that’s when it all goes south.
>
> That’s when you want someone in your corner.
>
> Someone who will fight tooth and nail.
>
> Lawyers, we’re like health insurance.
>
> You hope you never need it, but, man, oh, man, not having it? No.

The bot is basically Ciro’s lawyer, always loyally on his corner of the fighting ring.

There is only one bug with the bot as of 2021: if a [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) with unverified email makes several comments very fast, only the first one generates the reply, see e.g.:

* https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli/actions/runs/1097719382
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/cirosantilli/issues/52#issuecomment-892632342

Ciro is however curious how those unverified accounts can comment at all, as that seemd impossible when he last tried it with a dummy account, to be confirmed.

##### Ciro Santilli's wife (三西猴的老婆)

Born and raised in China: [Why does Ciro Santilli love China so much? (为什么三西猴喜欢中国那么多？)](#why-does-ciro-santilli-love-china-so-much?-(为什么三西猴喜欢中国那么多？)).

She and her mother do [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)), see also: [Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong just because his wife and mother-in-law do it? (三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)](#does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-just-because-his-wife-and-mother-in-law-do-it?-(三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)).

Believes to be descendant of the brother of a recent Qing emperor, see also: [Ciro Santilli's claim to the Qing Dynasty throne (三西猴清朝皇帝觊觎)](#ciro-santilli's-claim-to-the-qing-dynasty-throne-(三西猴清朝皇帝觊觎)).

For this same reason, her father, who Ciro’s wife worships, spent around 10 years in the 50’s for being branded a counter revolutionary rightist (右派) during one of [Mao’s](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976)) purges, possibly:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_to_Suppress_Counterrevolutionaries https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/镇压反革命运动
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Rightist_Campaign https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/反右运动

It is also for this reason that many Manchu changed their names to hide their Manchu origins, which makes reconstructing their family tree much harder, as mentioned at: https://www.scmp.com/article/982136/proud-manchu-reclaims-his-rich-heritage for the purposes of [Ciro Santilli's claim to the Qing Dynasty throne (三西猴清朝皇帝觊觎)](#ciro-santilli's-claim-to-the-qing-dynasty-throne-(三西猴清朝皇帝觊觎)).

Ciro’s wife:

* studied in [one of the best universities of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Science_and_Technology_of_China)
* met Ciro his wife when they were in possibly the [best engineering university in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/École_Polytechnique) after she had refused opportunities to go to the USA
* obtained a PhD in [number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) in one of the [best mathematics universities in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_and_Marie_Curie_University)

and is way smarter than Ciro.

[Wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) can say many things about her, but claiming that she is not intelligent or has no culture or would have any difficulty in obtaining a qualified worker VISA without a marriage, is a lost argument from the start, she would likely kick your butt in a raw intelligence competition.

Ciro is actually the lucky one for having found her!

The fake "the woman makes the man" Obama story comes to mind [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spousal-success-story/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/spousal-success-story/) (Obama would never say that in public):

> One night President Obama and his wife Michelle decided to do something out of routine and go for a casual dinner at a restaurant that wasn’t too luxurious. When they were seated, the owner of the restaurant asked the President’s Secret Service if he could please speak to the First Lady in private. They obliged and Michelle had a conversation with the owner.
>
> Following this conversation President Obama asked Michelle, "Why was he so interested in talking to you?" She mentioned that in her teenage years, he had been madly in love with her. President Obama then said, "So if you had married him, you would now be the owner of this lovely restaurant," to which Michelle responded, "No. If I had married him, he would now be the President."

### How do different websites view Ciro Santilli's profile? (不同的网站如何看来 Ciro Santilli 的个人资料？)

[Politics should not be posted in technical websites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow 不应该在技术网站例如Stack Overflow和GitHub讨论政治](#politics-should-not-be-posted-in-technical-websites-such-as-github-or-stack-overflow-不应该在技术网站例如stack-overflow和github讨论政治) contains a more general overview. This contains website specifics.

#### Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is where [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) started his [Screen name keyword attack (网名审查关键字攻击)](#screen-name-keyword-attack-(网名审查关键字攻击)) originally in 2015 as explained at: [Why did Ciro Santilli start his keyword attack? (为什么三西猴开始他的关键字攻击？)](#why-did-ciro-santilli-start-his-keyword-attack?-(为什么三西猴开始他的关键字攻击？)).

For non-programmers, Stack Overflow is by far the leading programmer question and answer forum of the Internet.

A programmer’s daily job involves asking Google about 50 times a day "how to do X", and 90% of the time or more the best answer will be found on the Stack Overflow result that will be one of the top 3 results.

This makes Stack Overflow a fundamental tool of every programmer’s daily jobs.

The current community consensus says that keyword attacks are allowed:

* https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/267368/are-political-avatars-and-profiles-ok
* https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/299882/can-a-username-be-considered-spam
* https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/349131/users-political-display-name-triggering-government-action-against-users-who-vie

However, you can’t say "Public figure X is disgusting as a person" so [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛))s, could you please report Ciro making fun of Xi Jinping X and see what they do about it?

Oh, and you can’t criticize God either! https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/231334/is-it-acceptable-to-insult-god-in-a-user-profile

The Chinese law doesn’t allow Ciro’s profile unfortunately: [Real username law (2015)](#real-username-law-(2015))

Since you will fail through Stack Overflow moderation, please consider instead making a report on the [CAC report website (12321.cn, 12377.cn, 12339, 中央网信办举报网站)](#cac-report-website-(12321.cn,-12377.cn,-12339,-中央网信办举报网站)).

Some non-political China related stuff on Stack Overflow:

##### Stack Overflow forbids criticizing the character of genocidal political leaders like Xi Jinping

Edit: as was made clearer later on at [stack-overflow-mods-refuse-to-clarify-if-anti-ccp-imagery-is-allowed-or-not-2021](#stack-overflow-mods-refuse-to-clarify-if-anti-ccp-imagery-is-allowed-or-not-2021), they just generally refuse to say clearly what is allowed or not.

Ciro was actually quite shocked by this.

He thought more people on Stack Overflow would have sided with him and favored stronger freedom of speech.

But this event made him notice that people in Stack Overflow simply didn’t push back against Ciro’s anti Xi Jinping campaign because they don’t know who the fuck Xi Jinping is, or they don’t care, or they are completely hypocrite and allow criticizing Xi Jinping but not Trump.

But they do know who Trump is, and "offending Trump" makes their feeble little feelings be hurt, and they must maintain their sacred "[political correctness](#censorship-of-"politically-incorrect-speech"-(审查政治不正确言论))" at all costs, even when talking about politicians. Including that the cost of freedom.

This therefore morally justifies the take-down attempts made by hundreds of [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛))s against Ciro’s anti Xi Jinping content.

First by initiative of Stack Overflow employee [Cesar Manara (Brazilian)](https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/508266/cesar-m), the sentence:

> I think Trump is disgusting as a person

was removed from Ciro’s profile and notified.

In response, Ciro created a meta thread to confirm that the community agreed, and they did: [Can I say on my profile that I find that an (ex) president of a country or other major political public figure is “disgusting as a person”?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361486/can-i-say-on-my-profile-that-i-find-that-an-ex-president-of-a-country-or-other) and the community agreed with the removal: it reached only 5 upvotes and 25 downvotes. Ciro’s profile at the time was linked to Trump’s ban on social media: [trump-ban-is-bad.md](trump-ban-is-bad.md).

Ciro then created [If a politician has committed genocide, can I say on my profile they look like Winnie-the-Pooh to insult them because they hate that?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361493/if-a-politician-has-committed-genocide-can-i-say-on-my-profile-they-look-like-w) was it was also mostly downvoted, and deleted, without any answer. Archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20210227034430/https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/361493/if-a-politician-has-committed-genocide-can-i-say-on-my-profile-they-look-like-w also reproduced at: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/198#issuecomment-787047672 The deletion voters were:

* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/215590/polygeo (Australia, big Geographic Information System person, real name based on [https://polygeo.com.au/elearning-videos/](https://polygeo.com.au/elearning-videos/) "Graeme Browning")
* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/135565/journeyman-geek (Singapore). Site elected admin at the time, which implies that his deletion cannot be undone by non-admins. TODO are they born in Singapore? If yes they might also be pro Xi Jinping, which is a clear conflict of interest with freedom of speech. But their English sounds perfect, so Ciro is not sure if it is common for Singapore natives or not.
* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/140890/martijn-pieters (UK, lots of Python rep)

There was no yes/no answer by anyone, because the of cowardice and hypocrisy:

* saying "you can" would imply you can criticize Trump
* saying "you can’t" would imply they support genocide

So their brains just tilted, and they clicked the "delete" button as the only possible resolution. The overly speedy deletion of posts was then raised as an issue two days later for an unrelated post: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/405585/can-we-slow-down-on-the-deletes-on-meta-folks

Then Ciro created an answer to ["Does the Be Nice policy require SE users to “be nice” to people who are not SE users (e.g. public figures)?"](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/286082/does-the-be-nice-policy-require-se-users-to-be-nice-to-people-who-are-not-se-u/361497#361497) which is a superset of the previous ones referred by them. That post is reproduced at https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/198#issuecomment-787047242 It cites the case in which the law was tested, but it was single-handedly by journeyman-geek (from Singapore) without any justification.

Ciro then finally updated his profile picture to contain [Real photo of Xi Jinping edited to look like Winnie the Pooh. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/dcabzh/this_image_of_xi_jiping_as_winnie_the_pooh_is/).](#xi-pooh-photoshop), archive at: https://archive.vn/iV1L8 to test the Winnie-the-Pooh case which people simply refused to answer. Let’s see show that goes. As Ciro learned however, only wumaos will continue to complain, and due to hypocrisy their complaints will be ignored.

Other users who publicly went against freedom of speech in that case (in the name of "political correctness"):

Freedom of speech in social media is truly threatened by the [Censorship of "politically incorrect speech" (审查政治不正确言论)](#censorship-of-"politically-incorrect-speech"-(审查政治不正确言论)).

##### Stack Overflow political image answer placeholder (2021)

The deleted answer was https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/83446/gimp-how-to-combine-two-images-side-by-side/145543#145543

It used [Ciro Santilli’s CC By-SA Tank Man image](#tank-man-cc-by-sa).

Of course, once again, just like mentioned at [Stack Overflow forbids criticizing the character of genocidal political leaders like Xi Jinping](#stack-overflow-forbids-criticizing-the-character-of-genocidal-political-leaders-like-xi-jinping), people prefer to:

* feel safe and good in their fake cocoon rather than have freedom. While people are dying, right now, in [Xinjiang "re-education" camps (新疆再教育營, 2017-)](#xinjiang-"re-education"-camps-(新疆再教育營,-2017-))

Ciro’s reply:

The mods then changed their discourse to mention spam rules rather than only on the "people will feel bad" aspect:

> The [code of conduct](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/conduct):

> Be inclusive and respectful.
>
> Exposing others to images of violent and traumatic events is not respectful to those on whom those images have a strong effect.

OK, the spam argument would likely win.

Ciro then hacked the images to his ["The world is perfect"](#the-world-is-perfect) [kitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch) placeholder, and mods approved it, so here we go.

Ciro was planning the following meta post, but gave up on it:

Instead of redoing the tutorial from scratch, Ciro just pasted the new image on top of the old one Stack Exchange censored: [Ciro Santilli’s CC BY-SA Tank Man image](#tank-man-cc-by-sa). Borders of the censored image were intentionally left over however as a reminder that Stack Exchange censors. This is a work of art.**

##### Stack Overflow mods refuse to clarify if anti-CCP imagery is allowed or not (2021)

This one again highlights the hypocrisy of many people in the West: we decide who is good and who is evil. The CCP is now evil, so you can criticize it, even if it shocks Chinese people. Ah, Nazism shocks us, even though it is an event from the past, so that you can’t do. You can only shock the Chinese people, not us.

Or: we like human rights. But not potentially disturbing someone at work even slightly is more important.

Opened a meta thread for this at: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/366163/can-i-use-images-such-as-from-tiananmen-square-protests-to-criticise-the-chinese ([archive](https://archive.ph/56KK2)) where the top answer was:

> We refuse to make a public decision.

In response, Ciro wrote the following essay on his profile page: [stack-exchange-lost-freedom-of-speech.md](stack-exchange-lost-freedom-of-speech.md).

The following quote from [Ron Maimon](http://cirosantilli.com/ron-maimon) comes to mind:

> Unfortunately, when you’re in a minority, the only way to correct the consensus view is to just shout it, and repeat it, until people go and look and check for themselves. The reason is that it creates an adversarial atmosphere where the people have to pick sides, ***and they don’t like to pick sides, they would rather have everyone be happy***. So when you have to pick sides, what do you do? You either butt out, you just leave it alone, you run away. Or you sit and review the evidence until you know which side to pick.

Notable people who went against in the comments:

* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/295232/glorfindel from the Netherlands commented "As the Dutch police say "if you’re asking for attention, you get attention".". No attempt to address the question at all. Just a direct "I’m right, you’re wrong, and I’m glad you were punished".

* https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/353058/holyblackcat "The mods and/or SE staff might not have clear guidelines in place yet, and I bet the last thing they want to do now is to figure out such guidelines to answer your question.

The interesting thing is that none of them had the courage to actually say "forbid Tiananmen", "forbid Falun Gong". But they all said "forbid not suitable for work". But they won’t clarify if "not suitable for work" includes "not suitable for work in China".

On their next reply, they tried to dodge a directly reply, but suggested that anti-CCP imagery is forbidden:

> > All the above are considered highly shocking to many Chinese people, due in part to their strict censorship rules, and not suitable for the workplace in China.

If you do so, please feel free to also open an issue on this repository saying why you believe the site policy has been violated.

Those issues will be marked with: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Aabuse-report+

It will be fun to watch you try, and fail.

This is because you do not understand how important the concept of [freedom of speech is](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)) in the West, and how amazing it feels when you are right, and it protects you.

The only thing that would work is if the Chinese government makes a gov-takedown on this repo: [GitHub gov-takedowns (由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的GitHub官方列表)](#github-gov-takedowns-(由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的github官方列表)), in which case: [Strategy if this repo gets added to GitHub gov-takedowns (如果此 repo 被添加到 GitHub gov-takedowns 中的策略)](#strategy-if-this-repo-gets-added-to-github-gov-takedowns-(如果此-repo-被添加到-github-gov-takedowns-中的策略)).

In order to get this repository in gov-takedown, your best bet is to use the [CAC report website (12321.cn, 12377.cn, 12339, 中央网信办举报网站)](#cac-report-website-(12321.cn,-12377.cn,-12339,-中央网信办举报网站)).

##### GitHub censored subdomains (GitHub 审查的子域)

It appears according to [GreatFire (自由微博)](#greatfire-(自由微博)) however that there are some important GitHub censored subdomains, notably:

* [https://raw.githubusercontent.com](https://raw.githubusercontent.com), from which images and other downloads are served. Therefore all images served from GitHub should be broken in China
* [https://gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com), [https://en.greatfire.org/https/gist.github.com](https://en.greatfire.org/https/gist.github.com): meh, that’s useless, just create a github.com/notes repo and dump your stuff there

However, at least for raw, [geoscreenshot](#geoscreenshot) disagrees:

##### GitHub gov-takedowns (由其各自政府在某个国家审查的仓库的GitHub官方列表)

https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns

This official GitHub repository tracks which repositories are blocked in specific countries.

GitHub has absolute transparency about Government takedowns, which is awesome: https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns/tree/master/China

This makes that repo into a list of fun things.

As of 2019-05 there had only been only two takedowns by China however, compared to dozens by [Russia (俄罗斯)](#russia-(俄罗斯)). The Chinese commies are not big fans of transparency it seems.

As of 2020-03, besides the [Zhao](#programthink-(编程随想,-ruan-xiaohuan,-阮晓寰,-programmer-on-github)) takedown, all other takedowns happened in 2019, and most seem to be [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult))/[The Epoch Times (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#the-epoch-times-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media)) sponsored ways to [climb the wall](#censorship-circumvention-(翻墙,-科学上网)).

The message GitHub shows on the blocked countries is:

> Repository unavailable in your location
>
> This repository is currently disabled in your location. For more details please see the takedown notice.

Here are some examples of people reacting to the blocking of https://github.com/programthink/zhao/issues/38 as per https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns/blob/78775b09e64d85f08547287cab204b48b2491192/China/2016/2016-06-08-programthink-zhao.md from China (and likely on the entire repository, which appears to be the block granularity implemented):

To check China only takedowns such as this, we cannot use [Great Fire Analyzer](#censorship-monitoring-(审查监督)), which reports the page as accessible: the only tool [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) could find so far to capture a page from China a bit like Web Archive was: [geoscreenshot](#geoscreenshot)

The "Repository unavailable in your location" message shows, since [this repository is in gov-takedowns/china](https://github.com/github/gov-takedowns/blob/master/China/2016/2016-06-08-programthink-zhao.md).**

###### Strategy if this repo gets added to GitHub gov-takedowns (如果此 repo 被添加到 GitHub gov-takedowns 中的策略)

If this happens, we well proceed to create alternative repos `china-dictatorship-2`, `china-dictatorship-3`, etc. and it would be fun to see how that gets handled.

Edit: [china-dictatorship Chinese web browser block (2021, china-dictatorship 中国浏览器审查)](#china-dictatorship-chinese-web-browser-block-(2021,-china-dictatorship-中国浏览器审查)), [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) decided to create: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship-2 even though the repository hadn’t been added to gov-takedowns.

Ciro then later renamed it to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2 with an intentional typo to make the censorship noise even greater.

Can Github add an entire user to gov-takedowns? We shall find out.

Ciro also created a separate org for it to also prevent simple username blocks: https://github.com/coding-stuffs/china-dictatorshrip

But remember that we also have: [Mirrors of this page (此网页的镜像)](#mirrors-of-this-page-(此网页的镜像)), and that this can be easily rendered as a single HTML page and uploaded to any static website host.

* 2022-05-10 https://github.com/coding-stuffs/china-dictatorshrip and https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2/graphs/traffic traffic went mysteriously from 30 and 20 unique daily visitors respectively to just 1 or 2
* 2022-05-17 renamed https://github.com/coding-stuffs/china-dictatorshrip to https://github.com/codin-stuffs/cihna-dictatorshrip to see if the is a URL-based browser block. Keeping https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2 unchanged for now as a control. 2022-05-18 immediately back to 175. Then since 05-20 fell to 30/daily as before. I wonder where the 175 came from. Maybe there is some fast-track block that does not fully block?
* 2022-05-19 renamed https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-2 to https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorhsip-3 to see if traffic also goes back up like coding-stuffs. Do [wumaos know their regexes](#wumao-(五毛))? Traffic immediately back to 50/60 daily.

##### GitHub "This repository may contain objectionable content" (此仓库可能包含令人反感的内容)

GitHub has a veru little known feature called:

> This repository may contain objectionable content

TODO exact Chinese phrase on UI.

When GitHub admins set this on a repository, it has the following effects:

* the repository cannot be seen by logged off users! Trying to do that results in a redirect. This puts such repositories at great disadvantage on search engine optimization
* the first time you visit the repository, they ask you if you want to continue

This is not a transparent mechanism, as it does not clearly state why the repository has objectionable content.

Known repositories with that enabled:

* [duty-machine GitHub account (责任机器GitHub用户)](#duty-machine-github-account-(责任机器github用户)) as of August 2021 [https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine](https://github.com/duty-machine/duty-machine):

How does that message get added exactly?

And you are forced you to login to view that repository!

Incredible, a hidden undocumented semi-hide-repo feature.

* https://www.oschina.net/ their website

At https://gitee.com/mirrors they mirrors 21 thousand repositories as of 2021, updating them daily, with the goal of having "higher download speeds" in mainland China. Not that their speed is shit because of censorships of course.

#### Zhihu censorship (知乎审查)

More general censorship discussion at: [Censorship (审查)](#censorship-(审查)).

Examples of Zhihu censorship:

##### Ciro Santilli's Zhihu purge 2019-11-03 (三西猴被知乎抹去)

On this day, not only the posts made by Ciro himself were deleted: he had never asked any questions or made any Zhuanlan posts himself, only replied to those. But that content made by other users was still removed. Therefore, this is not just a simple user ban, but active censorship.

Ciro received an email from account@mail.zhihu.com:

> 您好，Ciro Santilli，很抱歉您的回答受到了牵连，您回答过的问题「github.com@cirosantilli 是谁维护的，为什么会收集邮箱地址？」因「违反互联网相关法律法规」已被删除。

followed by Ciro’s answer to [github.com@cirosantilli 是谁维护的，为什么会收集邮箱地址？](#github.com@cirosantilli-是谁维护的，为什么会收集邮箱地址？). Ciro could not login anymore, the login screen showed:

> 帐号已停用，请联系：user@zhihu.com

So likely someone must have used the fact that this was an edgy personally information release subject issue, and then someone from Zhihu decided to purge Ciro and anyone posts that ever talked about him.

Ciro’s blocked account:

* before deletion: https://web.archive.org/web/20190821075907/https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities
* after deletion (redirects to login page): https://web.archive.org/web/20191103071033/https://www.zhihu.com/signin?next=http://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities

Random unblocked control account: https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities ([archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20191103070652/https://www.zhihu.com/people/lu-zhen-yu-96-65/activities)).

Furthermore, all questions related to Ciro, including the posts criticizing him such as [https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25600138](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25600138) ([archive](https://archive.is/DkooN)), were taken down. This made Ciro laugh: in China, you can’t even criticize that which is censored, or your post also gets taken down.

Ciro then created an anonymous Zhihu account after this event.

Interestingly however, the following answer came up later on: [Answer to the Zhihu question "How do you evaluate Ted Chiang's 'Evil Chinese Characters' essay?" "如何评价姜峯楠（Ted Chiang）在纽约客上的随笔《坏汉字》？"的回答](#answer-to-the-zhihu-question-"how-do-you-evaluate-ted-chiang's-'evil-chinese-characters'-essay?"-"如何评价姜峯楠（ted-chiang）在纽约客上的随笔《坏汉字》？"的回答) and stayed up for at least 5 months, which indicates that Zhihu did a one-off removal, and did not set up a filter for Ciro’s name.

###### Ciro Santilli's Zhihu ban 2018-06-25

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) was banned from Zhihu on 2018-06-25 for "[Politically sensitive (政治敏感)](#politically-sensitive-(政治敏感))" content.

As a result, since that time I will be answering Zhihu questions as issues in this repo with the `zhihu` label: https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues?q=label%3Azhihu+

I have however never posted anything politically sensitive on Zhihu, unless my name and profile picture have reached that distinction, and therefore the ban is clearly an unfair per-person ban.

But of course, all is fair in love and war, and politics.

Posting any sensitive content on Chinese websites is a waste of time, since it only means that they will be removed and you will waste time creating a new account, I will never do that.

The only significant content I ever posted on Zhihu is the answer to: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710/answer/122827944 which is purely technical, and trivial replies on threads that other people have started about me. Have those people been blocked like me?

My posts are still up and it does not appear to be possible for people to see that I have been banned, but whenever I try to take any action on the website a popup appears saying:

> 由于严重违反 知乎社区管理规定 ，该帐号已被永久禁言

This includes liking, commenting, answering, asking or trying to update my profile to say that I have been blocked.

This message also shows on my public page for everyone to see: https://www.zhihu.com/people/cirosantilli/activities but they use some JavaScript scheme complicated enough that archive.is cannot capture it.

I still get notifications however, but I am unable to reply to them, especially given that all Chinese accounts, unlike mine, have no personal identifiable information due to the understandable fear Chinese citizens have of their own government, even though such accounts might be illegal in theory: [Anonymous accounts ban (2017)](#anonymous-accounts-ban-(2017)).

The only action that I can take now is to report abusive comments people make to me.

Obviously, the only effect of such ban is that I will create an [anonymous account](#anonymous-accounts-ban-(2017)) under Tor with a second cell phone if I wish to contribute in the future, and China will have less information about my political interests than before.

The private messages the website sends while banning you are:

> 知乎管理员 ：您好，根据用户举报，您的帐号发布了「[政治敏感](#politically-sensitive-(政治敏感))」内容，帐号已根据知乎社区规范被永久禁言。处理详情可查看社区服务中心。具体规范请查看知乎社区管理规定。 6月25日 16:37 回复 | 删除
>
> 知乎管理员 ：您好，根据用户举报，您的部分个人信息由于不符合知乎用户信息管理规范已被重置。用户名可以在设置页面中修改，修改后会自动进入审核等待通过；其他个人信息可以在个人主页中编辑。感谢您对知乎社区的理解和支持。 6月25日 16:37 回复 | 删除

Those messages contain links to: https://www.zhihu.com/terms2 | https://archive.is/wdXSz and https://www.zhihu.com/question/19551824 | https://archive.is/BrgV2

The ban came soon after I posted a link to my GitHub repo as a comment at: https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/ice-employee-list-github-linkedin/ maybe they are related.

###### Who reported Ciro Santilli on Zhihu (谁在知乎上举报了 Ciro Santilli)

At the same time the ban happened I received a public comment from user "Eureka" https://www.zhihu.com/people/crb912/activities | https://archive.is/1F3t6 on this thread: https://www.zhihu.com/question/46957710 | https://archive.is/PVOLd saying:

> 你滥用了github， 也滥用了Stackover。这个一个纯粹计算机、编程和知识分享的地方，请不要带入政治性的色彩。请不要这么做， 维护社区的非政治性、中立和技术性纯粹，是每个热爱cs的人应尽的义务。

I am unable to get a URL that shows the comment on archive.is, so I have no proof of this claim. If you trust me, then here is a screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/YCiEEax

Since I expect the ban lists to be private, I find it extremely likely that this was the user who reported me, unless both were simultaneously triggered by a third event which I have not seen. So correct me if I’m wrong here.

Users with the same user id `crb912`, related "Eureka" username or same profile picture, can be found at:

* https://www.weibo.com/crb912 (unable to archive) on [Weibo (新浪微博)](#weibo-(新浪微博))
* https://github.com/crb912 | https://archive.is/heGfd which suggests a possible real name

By Googling the email found on the GitHub repos, we find: http://www.360doc.com/content/15/0809/11/25724933_490492490.shtml | https://archive.is/2UnGL which might, at last, contain a photo of my nemesis.

My public message to the reporter whomever he may be:

> While you have also raised issues that were raised a thousand times before, and clearly answered in the FAQ, at least you were able to take some actual action leading to an actual ban, and I respect you for that.
>
> I hope that one day you will redirect that cunning and initiative towards taking down the root cause of the problem, which are the Chinese communist Party and their Firewall themselves.

#### Quora

https://www.quora.com/profile/Ciro-Santilli

Quora is [a generally shitty website](https://cirosantilli.com/quora), with mechanisms that allow [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) to quench freedom of speech.

Quora is a major platform for [Astroturfing](#astroturfing).

Ironically, as usual, is it also blocked in China:

* according to [GreatFire (自由微博)](#greatfire-(自由微博)): https://en.greatfire.org/https/www.quora.com
* 2018-03 news coverage https://www.businessinsider.com/china-banned-zhihu-over-censorship-2018-3?r=US&IR=T

Examples of activity related to Ciro Santilli:

* 2016 Ciro Santilli’s profile was blocked because it had Chinese keywords on both my username and credentials. Justification: "non-English".

* 2017 created one in English: Cook [Tiananmen Square](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)) Noodle Shop, from [Falun, Sweden (法轮，瑞典的城市)](#falun,-sweden-(法轮，瑞典的城市))

  Added my Noodle shop to maps: https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Tiananmen+Square+Noodle+Shop/@60.6132538,15.6687509,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x94603408e3c63fb3!8m2!3d60.6132538!4d15.6687509

  Leach websites that picked it up: https://kvalster.se/Falu/Uthyres/Lagenheter/Gammelvagen_49_1417351

Quora is also shitty because wumaos can downvote your answer privately regardless of reputation and make it become collapsed as "Answer may need improvement", which means it goes to the bottom and readers have to click an "expand collapsed answers" button to see it, so that very few people will ever see it.

Then have to appeal and wait for moderators to evaluate it.

This happened for example at: https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli (see also [What happens if you wear a T-shirt with censored words in China? (如果你在中国穿一件带有审查词的 T 恤会怎样？)](#what-happens-if-you-wear-a-t-shirt-with-censored-words-in-china?-(如果你在中国穿一件带有审查词的-t-恤会怎样？))).

Ciro appealed in 2020-03-10 and the answer was reinstated on day later, but by then the question was already not being suggested as much to readers, and the other wumao answers (which criticize the USA rather than answering the question about China).

While there is some probability that the answers themselves are not wumaos, their upvoters almost certainly are and must be investigated.

Other shitty aspects of Quora include:

* block [Wayback Machine (web.archive.org, 网站时光机)](#wayback-machine-(web.archive.org,-网站时光机)) archives with their robots.txt, gotta use [archive.today (archive.is)](#archive.today-(archive.is))
* automatically add random topics that you don’t care about to your suggestions, with no easy way to prevent that.
* questions cannot have more than one sentence. There used to be a question body, but it was replaced with a "link for context". Ridiculous.

As a result, on the few occasions that Ciro posts on Quora, all content will also be mirrored here. Ciro’s China Quora answers include:

* [What would happen if I walked around Beijing with a t-shirt that said "freedom of speech is pretty great"?](https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-I-walked-around-Beijing-with-a-t-shirt-that-said-freedom-of-speech-is-pretty-great/answer/Ciro-Santilli) ([archive](https://archive.is/PxjJA)) see also: [What happens if you wear a T-shirt with censored words in China? (如果你在中国穿一件带有审查词的 T 恤会怎样？)](#what-happens-if-you-wear-a-t-shirt-with-censored-words-in-china?-(如果你在中国穿一件带有审查词的-t-恤会怎样？))
* [What is the net worth of Xi Jinping?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-net-worth-of-Xi-Jinping/answer/Ciro-Santilli) see also: [Panama papers (巴拿马文件, 2016)](#panama-papers-(巴拿马文件,-2016))

Some [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)):

* [http://archive.is/WzIcg](http://archive.is/WzIcg): a Han supremacist!

* on the web UI rendering replies can be either likes (推 as in 推荐), dislikes (噓, hush!) or neutral (right arrow)
* per-page threads are basically flat. You can however reply to another post with a "Re:" post. One application of this seems to be to post images which might only be allowed on the thread starters, e.g.: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602324724.A.CA0.html is a "Re:" to https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/joke/M.1602211516.A.3FB.html It is not clear if Re: and original posts are interlinked in any way.

TODO: can anyone comment, without having a Taiwanese university address? This suggests no: https://www.reddit.com/r/taiwan/comments/1etbvb/anyone_on_pttcc_advice_suggestions/ Also asked at:

* https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Can-you-comment-on-the-PTT-Bulletin-Board-System-at-ptt-cc-from-Taiwan-without-working-or-studying-at-a-Taiwanese-university
* https://github.com/cirosantilli/china-dictatorship/issues/92

A source informed Ciro that now only [NTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Taiwan_University) alumni can have an account.

Maybe the email requirement is the only way to prevent [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) from flooding the website.

Normal people see it on a web viewer hosted on: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/index.html

However it is fucking impossible to web archive that web interface because there is a cookie I’m 18-years-old confirmation before the first connection.

This shows how to connect for the first time: https://www.ptt.cc/index.firstbbs.html

One attempt is:

```
luit -encoding big5 telnet ptt.cc
```

But the main page says:

"本站目前暫停開放新帳號註冊。" "This site is currently suspended for new account registration."

And you try `new` it says: "目前無法註冊帳號![按任意鍵繼續]" "Account cannot be registered at this time."

OK, ptt2 went further:

```
luit -encoding big5 telnet ptt2.cc
```

Then there is a registration process that seem to require you to prove that you work at Taiwanese university, but not sure it is mandatory to post.

But I couldn’t find Gossiping there either, which is the only board that matters, so not sure it is on this server.

> The reason why chonglangTV was blocked was "disclosure of personal information". It is suspected that they have something to do with a "patriotic pink" named "Xu Hao" (徐好) who claimed to be an employee of a bank in Shanghai. "Xu Hao" claimed that he used his power to intercept multiple donations to Ukraine, and was later "opened the box" by netizens. (i.e. starting with personal information).

##### Many people in the West don't fully appreciate the danger of China 许多西方人没有完全意识到中国的危险

[The Great Translation Movement (大翻译运动官方推号)](#the-great-translation-movement-(大翻译运动官方推号)) is a good movement because many people in the West do not fully appreciate the level of dictatorship in China.

E.g. a well educated friend of Ciro once asked him circa 2020 which one he thought was worse: the terrible president of Brazil at the time, [Jair Bolsonaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jair_Bolsonaro), or [Xi Jinping (习近平, 2012-∞, Heil卐!)](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!))!

It is of course impossible to compare individuals in completely different situations, but how can you not point the finger to the major dictator! It is like asking who do you hate the most, [Hitler](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)) or Donald Trump! That question was an eye opener.

## Separatism (分离主义, Taiwan 台湾, Xinjiang 新疆, Hong Kong 香港)

If a large number of people in a given region want to leave an country strongly or have greater autonomy, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) believes that they should be allowed to do so.

Rationale:

* if they don’t feel they are getting a good deal out of your country, it is unfair to keep them in
* keeping them in the country forcibly implies large scale violation of human rights: mass incarceration and removing freedom of speech.

  Which in turn implies terrorist backslash.

  All of which are against [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))'s principles.

At this timestamp, survivor [Felix Mueller](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_E._Müller) whose girlfriend was killed in the attack comments that it is when people don’t have an official way to express their needs due to censorship that they are more likely to turn to terrorism to express themselves.**

  video::fASh2_RzMuE[youtube,height=400,width=600,start=1170]

What makes Ciro the maddest is the censorship. If you are going to put people in jail, write a clear law about it, and let international reporters come to see the situation.

But why do you do something and then hide it? Maybe because you are not doing the right thing?

Ciro also believes that although terrorists must be fought with all our strength, they must also be given some degree respect (interspersed simultaneously [with humour](#sacred-cows)). He sometimes prefers the term "warriors" or "fighters", because their actions are largely indistinguishable from many ideological or purely greed based actions that larger nation states have done many times over and over. It is just a war, plain and simple.

The reason why they kill mostly civilians is that they don’t have the means to kill the presidents those civilians elected. An amazing scene from [The Battle of Algiers (1966)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Algiers) comes to mind. After the head of the [Algerian independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War) movement and terrorist, [Larbi Ben M’hidi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larbi_Ben_M%27hidi) is arrested, the French military let him be interviewed by the press on 4 March 1967 https://youtu.be/uHWZkiBuKGY?t=5312 (TODO real words? Cannot find source):

Translation:

> Journalist: Don’t you think that it is cowardly to use the handbags and pushchairs of your women to transport your bombs? Those bombs that make so many innocent victims? [Earlier in the movie, we saw women carriying bombs into the French areas of Algiers through those means]
>
> Larbi Ben M’hidi: And you, don’t you think that it is much more cowardly to drop on defenseless villages your napalm bombs that kill thousands times more? Obviously, with airplanes, it would have been much more convenient for us. Give us your bombers, and we will give you the pushchairs.

Original text:

> Journalist: Ne trouvez-vous pas plutôt lâche d’utiliser les sacs et les couffins de vos femmes pour transporter vos bombes? Ces bombes qui font tant de victimes innocentes?

> Larbi Ben M’hidi: Et vous, ne vous semble t-il beacoup plus lache de larguer sur des vilages sans défence vos bombes au napalme qui tuent mille fois plus d’innocents? Évidement, avec des avions, ca aurait été beaucoup plus comode pour nous. Donnez vous vos bombardiers monsieur, et on vous donnera les couffins.

Taiwan is not a case of [Separatism (分离主义, Taiwan 台湾, Xinjiang 新疆, Hong Kong 香港)](#separatism-(分离主义,-taiwan-台湾,-xinjiang-新疆,-hong-kong-香港)).

Taiwan is a completely separate country split due to civil war, long ago.

Almost every country, and all reasonably powerful countries, have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. They just don’t call them diplomatic relations to not piss off China so they can keep doing business.

The fact that most countries in the world does officially recognize Taiwan as a country is a joke, considering that the only thing keeping it afloat is the West’s military threat.

[The West must not](#what-should-western-countries-do-about-china?-(西方国家应该怎么对待中国？)) let China advance and take more territories. The more they take, the more they will want.

The West must protect China’s neighboring countries with military support and assurance.

The West must recognize Taiwan for what it is: a separate country, under threat of invasion, and in need of support.

If China’s claim to Taiwan is valid, then Taiwan also has an equally valid claim on China.

If China’s claim to Taiwan is valid, then so will its claim to any other country.

China, if you want to claim that Taiwan is a part of you, just grow some balls and invade them already. Or just stop this stupid joke.

A well educated Mainlander who lived outside of China once told Ciro:

Ciro was shocked. He considered that person highly intelligent and not fully brainwashed! Reply:

Hololive is a [VTuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_YouTuber) management company from Japan, a subsidiary of a company called Cover Corporation.

When a VTubber either quits of is fired, they euphemistically often call it "graduation". But it is more like "death". The managemente company likely retains all rights to the character.

But basically is mostly some Japanese chicks that have live generated anime like virtual avatars that motion track them. They are meant to feel like real-world anime characters, as they can reply to comments to be more interactive.

Hololive is the main VTuber agency. These agencies are similar in nature to modern singer agencies, and even more so to the [agencies that build up Korean K-pop idols](https://cirosantilli.com/k-pop). They are all trying to turn your youth into idiotic superfluous robots, the opposite of science.

##### Xinjiang model camps for foreign media (新疆外媒示范营)

Starting in 2019, China officially invited foreign journalists to some of their model camps to show how happy people were.

It is hard to understand why they did this, as it just made everything worse for them, because everything was so obviously fake, and it actually allowed glimpses in some of the horrors. Why would a bunch of adults be playing games and learning useless stuff rather than be with their families working to earn money?

Online commentators have compared such camps to:

* [Nazi](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)) model concentration camps which foreign people were invided to see, e.g. [commented by the BBC itsef](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-china-blog-48700786)
  * [Theresienstadt Ghetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresienstadt_Ghetto)
    * allowed a Red Cross visit in 1944
    * https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0194445/plotsummary 1944 Nazi propaganda film about it
      * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZt92quVOsg contains a soccer match scene from it
      * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7nAfaLlqkE shows some scenes of children eating happily
    * [Paradise Camp (1986)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Camp) is an Australian documentary about it
  * [Sonnenburg concentration camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnenburg_concentration_camp)
* [Potemkin village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potemkin_village)

There is only one solution to Hong Kong’s problem:

* give inhabitants people easy VISAs to leave China, with priority to the rich/educated ones. Give them free language courses on the country of arrival, and help them find jobs
* treat Hong Kong exactly like any other part of China, removing any special commercial treaty with the reagion, which it has enjoyed for many years

These have started happening seriously in response to the [Hong Kong National Security Law (香港国安法, 2020)](#hong-kong-national-security-law-(香港国安法,-2020)).

1995 video game realistically depicts the fight of Hong Kong against the Communist Party predicted to happen [at the handover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handover_of_Hong_Kong), featuring Bruce Lee (often represented as [Jackie Chan](#entertainers-who-support-the-ccp-(支持中共的艺人))) who returned from the grave to join the fight and kick [Jiang Zemin’s](#jiang-zemin-(江泽民,-1989-2002)) ass.

The dead body from the game over screen was taken from a still from a video of the [1992 Bosnian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_War): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCDWyzZyNdw

The track is a sample of the ["I Love Beijing Tiananmen" (我爱北京天安门)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Beijing_Tiananmen) Cultural Revolution song that was popular before [Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 (六四事件)](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)) and later became an ironic protest song:

> 我爱北京天安门\

which means:

> I love Beijing Tiananmen Square\
> The sun rises over the Tiananmen

[Religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) created in the '80s by a Chinese dude called [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)).

With the support of the Communist Party to Qigong movements, it reached 70 million believers in 1999, at which point the commies decided they had to be shut down and banned the religion.

Li fled to the USA and lives near New York, where he continues to run the religion as of 2020.

<a name="aarvoll-shenyun"></a>**https://youtube.com/watch?v=IAQ14AnAsmU YouTubber under pseudonym "Aarvoll" (TODO full real name, face shown in channel all the time) tells about his experience playing trumpet for Shen Yun in 2013 as a non-believer and Falun Gong in general. Reading the sacred books and doing Falun Gong exercises were mandatory. He also talks about [Falun Gong downplays the fact that it is highly organized (法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)](#falun-gong-downplays-the-fact-that-it-is-highly-organized-(法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)). Ciro agrees/finds what he says convincing. In one interesting anecdote, he tells how although Li Hongzhi claims to be a God, he looked like an average slightly overweight dude, and had a trumpet since he used to play it, but couldn’t really play it because he hadn’t practiced in so long. He also comments on the obvious fact that Li does not speak English very well, e.g. on the Shen Yun tour bus he was there one day answering questions, and a translator was needed.**

Amazing Cultivation Simulator ([Baidu](#baidu-baike-(百度百科,-chinese-censored-wikipedia-clone)): [了不起的修仙模拟器](https://baike.baidu.com/item/了不起的修仙模拟器/23624221)) is [Rimworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RimWorld)-like Chinese game which was a large hit in China ([700k sales as of 2020](https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/amazing-cultivation-simulator-is-a-rimworld-style-sim-has-already-sold-700000-copies-in-china-and-now-its-getting-an-english-release/)) and then went on to be translated into English. In it, you join a Qi Gong [cult](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)), and level up your Qi Gong magical abilities by practicing the Gong (练功). Falun Gong basically claims the same thing, but for real life. Ciro believes that a great part of the appeal of Falun Gong is the gamification of life development, much like that video game does, see also: [Promised Powers or Knowledge (Orange Papers, 应许的功能或知识, 橙色文件)](#promised-powers-or-knowledge-(orange-papers,-应许的功能或知识,-橙色文件)). It is also interesting to note that such Qi Gong-like are present in a more or less popular video game, which shows that such ideas are widely known in China, while they are not widely known in the West. Notably, Qi Gong ideas are widely present in [Wuxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia) (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/武侠文化(武侠), lit. martial knight-errant) novels, or slightly more specifically [xianxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianxia_(genre)) ([仙侠](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/修真小说) lit. God knight-errant), the most popular version of Chinese [high fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fantasy) ([古典奇幻](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/古典奇幻)).

[...]. A sect has outer disciples that will happily do all your mundane, tedious labour for a competitive salary of about zero dollars.

### Why is it important to discus Falun Gong's even if you don't believe in it? (为什么不信仰法轮功也很重要要讨论它？)

The main reason [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) emphasizes Falun Gong is that it shows how the CCP can mercilessly crush a 70 million strong group (according to CCPs own statistics) out of a population of 1.3B in 2000, i.e. 5% of the population, and of course not because of [Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong just because his wife and mother-in-law do it? (三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)](#does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-just-because-his-wife-and-mother-in-law-do-it?-(三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)), since Ciro is completely and totally unbiased.

If that number is correct, Ciro wonders curious what you would consider an important movement?

Anything much larger would take down the government and change China’s history forever.

Aren’t you concerned that you or your children might be part of the next 5% purge? See also: [Most Chinese people don't care about the minorities (大多数中国人不关心少数民族)](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族)).

OK, maybe the fact that 69 million of those 70 million were likely old ladies didn’t help much either. Tip to next [prophet](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)): make something that appeals to aspiring military officers.

### Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong? (三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)

No, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) is [agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism) ([不可知论](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/不可知论)) and therefore believes that all the metaphysics that [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) says is bullshit, just like any other [religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？).

Here are some things that he doesn’t like about Falun Gong for example: [Things Ciro Santilli dislikes about Falun Gong (三西猴不喜欢法轮功的事情)](#things-ciro-santilli-dislikes-about-falun-gong-(三西猴不喜欢法轮功的事情)).

Ciro believes Falun Gong can be split into two parts, like any other [religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？):

* the "self-help" "how to live well" part, including the physical exercises and meditation, which cannot be proven or disproved, like any other self-help and [political opinion](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？))
* the metaphysics, most notably, Li Hongzhi is a living God, and all other non verifiable things he claims like aliens, alternate dimensions, etc., see:
  * [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)
  * [Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言))

Ciro thinks that FLG’s self-help part could potentially be good for you, just like many other meditative practices such as Yoga, Buddhist meditation, Tai chi, deep Catholic prayer, etc. As far as he has heard, all of it sounded good standard religious self-help: be peaceful, be good to others, etc. Like any other well managed religion, FLG does have good things to offer, see also: [Christine Marie’s interview](#christine-marie).

However Ciro believes that the metaphysics is all complete and utter bullshit, child stories made up by Li Hongzhi, and just as real as Father Christmas or the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).

Also the "obligation to reach Salvation" is boring like for many other prophetic [religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？).

From a purely strategic point of view, the metaphysics is a trade-off:

* some people will believe you are a freaking living God
* others will laugh at you and say you are a charlatan

It may be argued however that Li played this card beautifully: since all Chinese power is concentrated in the CCP, any non-CCP movement dies out, so he was better off long run playing the metaphysics game. The only other choice would have been joining the CCP.

To Ciro it is obvious that Falun Gong is just one of the many very similar movements that came out of the Qi Gong Boom, such as: [Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)). It just happens to be the one that survived due to better luck and strategy.

The absolute truth is already known by the [prophet](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), although he does not want to give clear evidence for reasons: [Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)), and Ciro finds that utterly boring. There’s no fun in living in a world where the absolute truth has been found.

For these reasons, Ciro cannot bother to read even into the self-help part: how can you read that when there is so much bullshit every other page?

Ciro would really like to know if [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) really believes in FLG himself, or is just a complete manipulating charlatan, but unfortunately we will never know that. Just imagine if before he died he published a video saying: "it was a joke, gotcha!". Now that would be ***epic***!

Since Ciro is good-natured, it’s hard for him to believe that he doesn’t believe in anything, how can anyone be that evil? Maybe he believes in part of it, but made up some stuff to sell it better, maybe with good intentions that selling the fake part would also lead more people to see the good part?

Like any other prophetic religion, FLG gives tiny evidence that you can directly feel through meditation. The energies, which Ciro believe are real feelings. And then using that entry point asks you to believe a whole lot more, that you can’t feel: [Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)).

This becomes especially strong when a critical mass of believers is reached, and then they start interpreting all sorts of events as miracles, and you start to believe other believers without questioning them, and a circle is formed.

This post by a former believer gives what Ciro feels is a realistic account that matches Ciro’s observations: [Me and Li by Ben Hurley (2017)](#me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-(2017)).

And yet, all those who love freedom, must oppose FLG ban, or be themselves enslaved by tyrants themselves: [Why does Ciro Santilli say that democracy is a religion just like Falun Gong? (为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)).

In any case, at least FLG got one thing right: the commies are [evil](#is-the-chinese-government-evil?-(中国共产党是邪恶的吗？)), and we have to get rid of them.

See also: [Falun Gong is fake (法轮功是假的)](#falun-gong-is-fake-(法轮功是假的)).

#### How much does Ciro Santilli know about Falun Gong? (三西猴对法轮功有多熟悉？)

He hasn’t read their [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) himself, no patience, but he has had [constant contact with believers](#does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-just-because-his-wife-and-mother-in-law-do-it?-(三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)) and so has an idea of its content.

Ciro has summarized his thoughts about [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) at: [Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong? (三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong?-(三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)) and [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)

### Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？

If asked if they follow a religion, most FLG believers will say "no", and [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) explicitly says that in [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), e.g. [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/jjyz52.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/jjyz52.htm):

> Falun Dafa is not a religion, but future generations will regard it as one.

E.g. they call themselves "practitioners" or "students" (学员) or "disciples of the Great Law" (大法弟子, or mare accurately, of [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))'s Law) instead of "believers", and their peers "practitioner colleagues" ([同修](https://baike.baidu.com/item/同修)). Non believers call them derogatorily "轮子"("little wheels"), or in friendly terms "轮友" (wheel friend).

And if you say you don’t believe in their FLG metaphysics bullshit, they will often reply "he does not understand".

To them, it is not about belief, the truth is clear, and you just don’t see it yet.

To this you should reply: "and you don’t understand that [Li Hongzhi](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) is a master manipulator dude who deceived you and millions of others".

But [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) strongly believes that this is just a language barrier/FLG propaganda question (see also [Different levels of truth (Orange Papers, 不同层次的真相, 橙色文件)](#different-levels-of-truth-(orange-papers,-不同层次的真相,-橙色文件))), and that 99.9999% of people in the West would classify FLG as a religion just like [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教)) if they are told about FLG’s beliefs:

* absolute truth comes from an enlightened [prophet](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), who is perfect and has superhuman abilities
* weekly in-person meetings (学法 "study the Fa", or more verbosely "study the law (of the universe (of [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))))"）or daily online meetings where they read from a [sacred book](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), either written by the prophet, or transcribed from his presentations to disciples, including the disciples questions, much like traditional Chinese texts like [Analects (论语, c. 475-200 BC)](#analects-(论语,-c.-475-200-bc)), just like Christians read from the Bible over and over again.

  In both cases, some believers claim that sometimes even reading the same text again gives them new insight.
* prescribed daily meditation exercise hours, somewhat like Muslim [Salah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah) ([礼拜](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/礼拜_(伊斯兰教))) prayers which they call [发正念 (fa1 zheng4 nian4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fazhengnian), which means "send righteous thoughts". They seem to believe that this meditation helps external good magic things happen, so it is half meditation half prayer.

  Also both Salah and Falun Gong have an element physical repetitive exercise component.

  And for those that are often online on the Falun Gong voice forums, some nice music is played before prayer times, just like Muslim [Muezzins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muezzin) (a type of priest) will do the [Adhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhan) (sang call to prayer, ideally from the minarets of a mosque)
* longer "less mandatory" [Qigong-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong) ([气功](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/气功)) exercises (lian4 gong1, 练功) followed by a meditation (打坐) and which they collectively call [修炼](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/修道_(道教)) "practice austerities". note that this term is borrowed from Taoism but possibly with different precise meaning. There are exactly 5 exercises (meditation being the fifth) some with a fun supernatural name, on [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) [https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006_4.htm](https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006_4.htm) "The Falun Gong Practice System":
  * Buddha Stretching a Thousand Arms
  * Falun Standing Stance
  * Penetrating the Cosmic Extremes
  * Falun Cosmic Orbit
* memorization of the [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), notably [Zhuan Falun (转法轮)](#zhuan-falun-(转法轮)), just like [Hafiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafiz_(Quran)) ([哈菲兹](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/哈菲茲_(稱謂))) in Islam
* higher intelligent beings ("Buddhas")
* [some believers who practice really well can also get some "supernatural powers"](#promised-powers-or-knowledge-(orange-papers,-应许的功能或知识,-橙色文件))
  * other dimensions, which some select people with vision superpowers can see, this being one of the supernatural powers that may be developed, the "Celestial Eye" [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_21.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_21.htm):

    > A cultivator of a particular attainment level can only see the scenes on that level. He cannot see or believe the truth beyond that level. Therefore, he only believes what he has seen on his own level. When he has not gone up to such a high level of cultivation, he would think those things do not exist and are incredible.

    and the "Supernormal Capability of Remote Sight" is a closely related ability: https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_22.htm:

    > A supernormal capability directly connected with the Celestial Eye is called the Remote Sight. Someone says that he can see scenes in Beijing, in America or scenes on the other side of the earth while sitting here.

    And finally there is also the past-future vision ability "Supernormal Capability of Total Recall" [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_23.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_23.htm):

    >     There is another supernormal capability which has a direct relation with the Celestial Eye. It is called Total Recall. Now there are six supernormal capabilities which are generally recognized in the world. They include the Celestial Eye, Remote Sight, and Total Recall. What is Total Recall? It is a supernormal capability with which one can know a person's future and past; if the ability is great, one can know the rise and decline of a society; if the ability is even greater, one can see the Law of the change of the whole celestial body.
* aliens that look like humans are amongst us, they gave us part of our modern technology, some are evil, others not so evil. E.g. [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980530L.html](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980530L.html):

  > Science, however, is not something gods imparted to humans. Instead, it was passed down to humans by alien beings inside the Three Realms, and for the purpose of controlling humankind. People’s belief in it has surpassed everything. But I tell you that precisely because of its shallowness, this science has caused the degeneration of morality in human society.

  Despite this however, Falun Gong benefits from information technology enormously. For example, many (most?) believers use the Internet daily to study the Fa, and to organize their [media outlets](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体)).
* meetings in which people tell their religious testimonies ("experience sharing" TODO Chinese name, possibly just "分享修炼的美好", e.g. [source](https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2015/9/29/分享修炼的美好-印尼召开修炼心得交流会（图）-316838.html)): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimony#Religion

  As Jesus put it in [Matthew 18:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018%3A20&version=NIV):

  > For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them

  which highlights the critical believer mass effect of reinforced beliefs.
* an impending [final judgment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment)-like event, which will happen "very soon" ([unspecified date](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言))), and in which the just will be rewarded

  Ciro predict that when [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) dies, the claim will be that he went to another dimension so save us all, therefore putting this final judgment on hold, a bit like Jesus.
* non-believers are fundamentally different from believers. Although non-followers who do good things are actually doing FLG without knowing it.

  FLG has a specific terminology for non-believers, which is translated in English as ["ordinary people"](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_new_4.html) (常人), as opposed to Falun Gong Believers, which Li calls Falun Gong disciples (大法弟子).

  Non-FLG people should therefore logically call Falun Gong believers [abnormal people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_psychology) ([异常人](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/異常心理學)) in return, much like Ciro likes to call the Chinese who call him 老外 as "老内".

  Like other aspects of FLG however, this appears in other religions, e.g. my mother mentioned the funny term used by her Protestant’s group term but Ciro forgot it, and you can see it in Harry Potter as well: [The Muggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle).
* [You can support FLG by doing X and Y, it is not mandatory, but why wouldn’t you since you are saving other people?](#falun-gong-downplays-the-fact-that-it-is-highly-organized-(法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)). Explaining that Falun Gong is good contrary to CCP propaganda also known as "Fa-rectification" in the English translation jargon.
* alternate dimensions
* pre-civilization: civilization is actually much older than what we believe, and was super advanced, but [societal collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse) events led us to forget about it, a bit like [atlantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantis).

  Notably, this also implies that the [theory of evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) is wrong, since there existed modern humans hundred of millions of years ago (the current scientific estimates for anatomically modern humans is [500,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_human)): https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_14.htm

  > Archaeologists have found in the world a kind of organism called "three-leaves insect", which came into being between 600 million and 260 million years ago, and became extinct thereafter. An American scientist found a fossil of "three-leaves insect", on which there was also a human footprint, left by a shoe he was wearing, and clearly printed on the fossil. Aren’t they joking with the historians? How could there possibly have been human beings 260 million years ago according to Darwin’s theory of evolution?
* [Maybe FLG will make you healthier, but no promises, but it will make you a better person, and that’s why you should do it, but if you really really believe, you get healthier](#falun-gong-believers-are-less-likely-to-take-necessary-medication-(法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物)). But people who seemed to be believers also die, because deep within their hearts, there was a belief problem.
* [Falun Gong believes that the CCP is literally a manifestation of real devils (法轮功认为中共是真正恶魔的化身)](#falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils-(法轮功认为中共是真正恶魔的化身))

From this, it is obvious that Falun Gong is just a [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age) ([新纪元运动](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/新纪元运动)) [syncretic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism) ([综摄](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/綜攝)) religion combining:

* [Qigong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong)
* [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), e.g.: the meditation, and usage of specific [hand mudras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudra). TODO does Li Hongzhi suggest that he is a [Maitreya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maitreya#Maitreya_claimants), just like Jesus suggested he was the [Messiah from Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants)?
* some aspects of [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教))

and whatever other crazy things [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) believes in.

Synchronism is of course the easiest way to start a new religion, because it attempts to divert the irrational belief of people in some unprovable bullshit into a new unprovable bullshit, but that resonates more with the current political situation. This is exactly [what Jesus did with Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants). And it is then exactly what the [Islam did to Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam).

Or you could call Falun Gong a [cult](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)), which is nothing but a new/small religion with negative connotation, and thus meaningless.

FLG is very similar to Scientology in Ciro’s view: a new religion that mixes elements of both old and new. And just like any other religion, [their practice must be allowed](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)).

But consider this: how to classify what a religion is?

Some would answer: science is what every one can perceive with their own senses.

But FLG followers claim to feel FLG energies when doing the exercises, and a few of them have the power of seeing the other dimensions.

On the other hand, how many of your friends have experienced the laws of quantum field theory or general relativity in a very direct way?

And aren’t pro-democracy believers also taking actions based solely on a shared belief, possibly organized by a pro-democracy leader?

From a purely strategic point of view, the "religion" denomination would be:

* bad to FLG because the concept of freedom of religion carries considerable weight in the West. And if you are not a religion, you are more likely to be a [cult](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)), which carries a black mark instead.
* good for FLG because people who already have a religion would be less likely to try it out and start believing

  Falun Gong’s recruitment strategy is to focus on the exercises first, and in particular its [health benefits](#falun-gong-believers-are-less-likely-to-take-necessary-medication-(法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物)) and then as some people start to feel things, they start introducing the metaphysics.

  Other new religions have also taken this "I’m not a religion approach", see e.g.: [Baha’i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baháʼí_Faith) [https://youtu.be/9qDN0COSvds?t=287](https://youtu.be/9qDN0COSvds?t=287).

#### Falun Gong believes that the CCP is literally a manifestation of real devils (法轮功认为中共是真正恶魔的化身)

Unlike [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) which does [not think most CCP politicians are actually evil](#is-chinese-politician-x-evil?-(中国政客x邪恶吗？)), Falun Gong seems to believe that they literally as in they are representatives of, or evil supernatural beings themselves.

E.g. [Jiang Zemin (江泽民, 1989-2002)](#jiang-zemin-(江泽民,-1989-2002)) is actually an evil frog in some alternate dimension, literally, not just memecally.

And those devils they are literally responsible for example for creating [Covid-19](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)), which is itself a magic force which tests the evil and good: [Falun Gong's view of epidemics (法轮功的流行病观)](#falun-gong's-view-of-epidemics-(法轮功的流行病观)).

And [Trump](#falun-gong-supports-donald-(trump,-法轮功支持特朗普)) likely represents a magical anti-devil force of the universe.

Some of the most direct [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) suggestions we could find: [https://en.falundafa.org/eng/HongYin5.htm](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/HongYin5.htm):

> The Red Devil uses lies and money to meddle with man

[https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20060209A.html](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20060209A.html):

> All along, lowlife secret agents of the wicked CCP have been constantly gathering so-called "Falun Gong intelligence."

Falun Gong gives the CCP too much credit. The CCP are just a bunch of lazy and greedy people like you and me.

#### Falun Gong preaching (法轮功传教)

[Street preaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-air_preaching) is an important aspect of Falun Gong, using stands and leaflets on the streets much like [Jehovah’s Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah’s_Witnesses).

Jargon:

* [讲真相](http://www.minghui.org/mh/glossary.html): "truth-telling"
* hongfa (TODO characters?)

The Falun Gong organization also specifies guidelines on how to preach, although these might not be [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), even though if they are not, it is extremely likely that [LHZ](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) is directly involved in their specification

Falun Gong has also used [phone call preaching](#some-falun-gong-people-make-phone-telemarketing-(一些法轮功人搞电话推销)).

All of this is part of their effort to "save people (救人)", i.e. convert them to Falun Gong.

[Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) personally heavily emphasises the importance of preaching in [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) TODO link/quote, and because of this is it a de-facto religious obligation, and a major part of [Making cult members work long hours for free (Orange papers, 让信徒免费长时间工作, 橙色文件)](#making-cult-members-work-long-hours-for-free-(orange-papers,-让信徒免费长时间工作,-橙色文件)).

**Falun Gong believers preaching on the street in London in 2016. This image taken from a believer website shows a typical local regular gathering of believers on weekends, or even week days if there are enough retired believers in the group. They will put on their exercise music, and do exercises to attract more followers. Someone will also stand on their stall giving out propaganda flyers, or asking people to sign petitions for Western governments to support Falun Gong, e.g. opposing their alleged [organ harvesting](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-the-allegations-of-organ-harvesting-made-by-falun-gong-believers?). In the case of touristic areas with Chinese people walking around, they will also ask the Chinese tourists to [quit the their CCP membership, possibly using a fake name](#tuidang-movement-(退党,-falun-gong-media)). [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) has to say: it is very amusing to see those Chinese people trying to pretend to ignore the censored religion, when some of them are clearly curious about it, especially the younger ones who didn’t see it live. Some just get mad, and say how the CCP is so great to them.

##### Some Falun Gong people make phone telemarketing (一些法轮功人搞电话推销)

Ciro Santilli has seen Falun Gong people making phone calls to people in China with to explain why FLG is with his own eyes, and therefore is sure it has happened on some scale.

Particularly during [Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)), Falun Gong ramped up the telemarketing calls and some voluntary believers were making calls all day nonstop.

Ciro does not know how the called numbers were obtained and if callees voluntarily signed up for it, but that feels extremely unlikely.

Interestingly however, many of the callees seemed interesting in what they had to say, and they often had long chats, Ciro was surprised by that. Maybe they were just bored senseless due to the Corona lockdown. Or maybe [many Chinese People actually don’t like their Government](#most-chinese-people-like-their-dictatorship-(中国大众支持他们的独裁)) and the CCP is fucked.

Also, of course, the callers received call scripts and guidelines to makes those calls, because obviously [Falun Gong downplays the fact that it is highly organized (法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)](#falun-gong-downplays-the-fact-that-it-is-highly-organized-(法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)).

Ciro strongly disapproves of this, Just like for any product, visual ads on the street are impossible to prevent, but any kind of advertising that generates notifications on feeds, or takes people’s time, is unacceptable.

As you can easily find on [Google (谷歌)](#google-(谷歌))/[Baidu (百度, Chinese Google)](#baidu-(百度,-chinese-google)), such calls may be reported in the [CAC report website (12321.cn, 12377.cn, 12339, 中央网信办举报网站)](#cac-report-website-(12321.cn,-12377.cn,-12339,-中央网信办举报网站)).

Ciro has not however seen them talking about making automated phone calls.

https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1940394/how-rampant-phone-scams-highlight-chinas-need-tighter also mentions that Falun Gong makes telemarketing in passing without any reference.

#### Is Falun Gong a cult? (法轮功是邪教吗？)

Does [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) think Falun Gong a cult? Yes.

Is the CCP a cult? Yes: [CCP cult (中共邪教)](#ccp-cult-(中共邪教)).

Is [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教)) a cult? Yes.

Is democracy a cult? Yes: [Why does Ciro Santilli say that democracy is a religion just like Falun Gong? (为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)).

Is modern science a cult? Maybe.

Therefore, the only question that matters for all the above is the same: are they good or bad cults?

Falun Gong clearly share many many many characteristics with what many people classify as a "cult", see e.g.: [Orange Papers (橙色文件)](#orange-papers-(橙色文件)).

However, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) strongly believes that so does any other existing religion e.g. Christianity, and that Falun Gong is not any worse or better than those other well known religions.

Ciro therefore believes that the only reasonable stances are to either:

* be against all religions (including Christianity and Falun Gong), and classify all of them as Cults
* allow both Christianity and Falun Gong to exist, and support religious freedom

but not "oppose Falun Gong" and support Christianity.

Some people will say: Falun Gong is a cult because it is too new and therefore obviously fake!

So, if I tell a lie today, will it become true in a thousand years? Or a truth today become a lie? The Romans called [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教)) the "Cult of Jesus"!

Try sending an email to [LHZ](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) asking him to [prove his powers to you](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)) :-)

Others will say: Falun Gong is a cult because its prophet is still alive!

But then, worry not, because Li Hongzhi was born in 1951, and therefore will almost certainly die by 2040, unless he truly is a living God as he claims.

Now, for the really important question of weather Falun Gong is a "good" or "bad" religion, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) has seen absolutely nothing in it that is worse than any [other major religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) say, e.g., [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教)).

Some possibly neutral Cult analysts analyzing if FLG is good or bad:

* https://www.icsahome.com/articles/the-prc-and-falun-gong-langone

Against:

* https://www.culteducation.com/group/1254-falun-gong.html

In the end however, since there is nothing obviously completely creepy about FLG, all such discussions are basically equivalent to ["is the Left better than the Right"](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)), and cannot be answered.

One interesting linguistic aspect is that "cult" normally translates in Chinese as "邪教" which means "Evil religion".

As mentioned before, Ciro does not believe that FLG is an "Evil Cult", just another "Acceptable Cult", and therefore would not use "邪教" to describe it.

Amusingly, [Li](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) calls the communists Communist Evil Party (中共邪党) in cannon, well played: https://gb.falundafa.org/chigb/jiangfa5_2.htm

The word "Cult" is much more ambiguous in English however, and does not necessarily imply "Evil" in certain contexts, just "worship".

For example, People from [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))'s mother’s Protestant Church in Brazil, all say that they are going "to the cult" ("culto" in Portuguese) when referring to when they are going to church to pray, sing and read the Bible together, here’s a Wikipedia page in Portuguese page about it: https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culto_(Evangelicalismo)

And obviously, the origin of the word "cult" is exactly the same as that of ["cultivate"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cultivate#Etymology) as in "cultivate the crops" (which is also how Falun Gong believers refer to practicing Falun Gong: "cultivation practice"). All of those come from the [Latin "colō"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cult#Etymology), which means simply "to protect".

##### CCP cult (中共邪教)

The CCP also has many cult-like characteristics, notably ["The Guru is always right"](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)), which is mentioned on [Orange Papers (橙色文件)](#orange-papers-(橙色文件)) itself under "The Guru is always right." (highlight by [Ciro](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))):

> The Guru, his church, and his teachings are always right, and above criticism, and beyond reproach.
>
> In some cults, the guru is dead, but the principle is the same. I use the word "guru" loosely here; in many cults the charismatic leader has the title of minister, priest, yogi, swami, prophet, or all-knowing wise man. ***Or even, "[Chairman Mao](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976))."*** In any case, the leader is always right.

And they also claim that [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholics_Anonymous) could be characterized as a cult. Very cool. What else could be powerful enough to get you off a physical addiction, than a mental addiction, right? The [Midnight Mass (2021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Mass_(miniseries)) miniseries by Netflix episode 2 makes that suggestion nicely on a side by side collage at about 8 minutes. It later mentions [Rational Recovery (RR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Recovery), which is a "non-religious" alternative to the AA.

> [Mao](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976)) is the Father\
> [Xi](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)) is the Son\
> The CCP is the Holy Spirit

Both Mao and Xi have produced their own sacred books which must be revered, much like [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))'s [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)):

* Xi’s: [Xi Jinping Thought (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想, 2017)](#xi-jinping-thought-(习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想,-2017))
  * illustrated version for children: [Xi Jinping Thought primary school textbook (2021, 习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想学生读本。小学高年级。)](#xi-jinping-thought-primary-school-textbook-(2021,-习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想学生读本。小学高年级。))
* Mao’s: [Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (Little Red Book, 毛主席语录, 1976)](#quotations-from-chairman-mao-tse-tung-(little-red-book,-毛主席语录,-1976))

Furthermore, both of those books are based on speeches, just like just like Li Hongzhi’s speeches become instant canon.

This devotion can also be seen in Xi’s benevolent personification: [Xi Dada (习大大, 2015)](#xi-dada-(习大大,-2015)).

This is also observed by [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) itself as a response to the CCP [accusing Falun Gong of being an Evil Cult](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)). E.g.: https://www.ntdtv.com/gb/2019/07/01/a102612683.html from [New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD, NTDTV, 新唐人電視台, Falun Gong media)](#new-tang-dynasty-television-(ntd,-ntdtv,-新唐人電視台,-falun-gong-media)), and Falun Gong is completely right here.

Amazing website talking about Cults and many other things!

The key page of the website is the "Cult Test": [https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html](https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html). This is a must read. It is basically the [TV Tropes](https://cirosantilli.com/tv-tropes) of Cults.

Down as of 2020-04 archive:

TODO who is the author? Copyright says by "A. Orange". Is it the real name, or just a pun for "I ate an orange"?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Orangepapers/comments/5sh7kg/any_info_on_what_happened_to_the_orange_papers/ mentions the creator’s first name is "Terry", and that the website went down due to financial trouble.

The website also offered compressed archives, but Ciro could not find any of those on the Wayback Machine, although it is hard to be sure because there are many different timestamps available, the section reads:

* `Orange_Papers-imgs000-2011-01-01.tar.gz`

A mirror with many broken links and images: http://aorange1.tripod.com/

And the website also has a Free Tibet flag at the bottom.

Many of the points highlighted at are very very interesting and Ciro feels that they apply strongly to [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)):

* "Instant Community" and "Instant intimacy": you instantly join the cult family, and are very very likely to believe or at least consider anything anyone else in the cult says about their religious experiences, no matter how far-fetched, even though it is not [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作))

  Conversely, this also poses a risk for the Cult Leader, as new community ideas can spread very quickly, and if you try to fight them off, they might create a [Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism).
* "Denigration of competing sects, cults, religions, groups, or organizations": yes, [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) does this all the time, see: [Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion))
* "Personal testimonies of earlier converts": see "experience sharing" at [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)
* "The group and its members are special", "Enemy-making and Devaluing the Outsider": see: "ordinary people (常人)" at [Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong? (三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong?-(三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？))
* "Front groups, masquerading recruiters, hidden promoters, and disguised propagandists": [Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体))
* "The Guru is always right", "You are always wrong", "No Graduates", "The Guru Is Extra-Special", "Everybody else needs the guru to boss him around, but nobody bosses the guru around", "The guru criticizes everybody else, but nobody criticizes the guru.": obviously: [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))
  * "Group-think, Suppression of Dissent, and Enforced Conformity in Thinking"
* Giggly wonderfulness and starry-eyed faith: [notably visible during in experience sharing](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)

There are also however some points which Ciro feels don’t apply, and Ciro praises Falun Gong for those:

* "Dual Purposes": not much of that, most of their propaganda is "we are persecuted unfairly by China", not "let’s help the poor"
* "The End Justifies The Means": Li has made it clear that believers must follow the laws of their countries. Cults that violate this tend to not last as long, this is the smart move for cult leaders.

And some points which Ciro feels apply which were mentioned in some other article, (or maybe in Orange Papers but he couldn’t find them, TODO find reference?)

* "No time for fun": how could you possibly spend leisure time watching television, etc. when you could be saving the world instead?
* "Focus on the persecution of the Cult": while obviously people who have been persecuted have the right, and almost an obligation, to look for help and share their stories, it is also clear that this is a selling point for the Cult.

  Why would a nation state attack a Cult? This could give the impression that it is because there is something powerful and true in the Cult, and actually menaces this nation state.

  For example, Falun Gong puts huge emphasis on its persecution in China, much like the [Martyrdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr) of the Catholic Saints is highly emphasised.

This is especially interesting, because the website does not mention Falun Gong at all it seems: it really seems that all those cults are very similar.

It should also be mentioned though that these points extend to any type of human organization, e.g. [other religions](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), [political parties](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)), job associations, etc.

###### Cult speak (邪教话，Orange Papers, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160205090248/https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q0.html#cq_cult_speak

"Cult-speak": see also "Newspeak" from [Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel (1984, 乔治·奥威尔 一九八四, 1949)](#nineteen-eighty-four:-a-novel-(1984,-乔治·奥威尔-一九八四,-1949)) and some common Falun Gong Cult-speak see: [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)

Falun Gong’s slogan is the quite direct to the point:

> 法轮大法好\
> Falun Gong is good

This is in part to fight off the mountains of anti-Falun Gong propaganda created by the [Chinese "Communist" Party (CCP, 中国共产党, 1949-, Cult of Mao/Xi, 毛习邪教, 10.000 year Reich)](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich)).

Their core values are:

* Truthfulness (真, Zhēn). Self explanatory, and the opposite of the [Chinese "Communist" Party (CCP, 中国共产党, 1949-, Cult of Mao/Xi, 毛习邪教, 10.000 year Reich)](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich)). Although they sometimes violate that (unknowingly?) for the greater good of the cult, e.g. [Falun Gong media is not transparent about its affiliation (法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)](#falun-gong-media-is-not-transparent-about-its-affiliation-(法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)).
* Compassion (善, Shàn)
* Forbearance (忍, Rěn): definition according to Oxford Languages: "patient self-control, restraint and tolerance". So in other words: chill out and meditate. And don’t do drugs or anything excessive like that.

The slogan and the core values are often placed together as:

> 法轮大法好。真善忍好。
> Falun Gong is good. Truthfulness, compassion and forbearance are good.

###### Careful control of your image (Orange Papers, 小心控制你的形象, 橙色文件)

The cult leader is a master at controlling how people view them.

One aspect of that, is after reaching a certain critical mass of mindless followers, to limit your public appearances to situations in which you have the most control, and notably being surrounded only by your believers.

Because of course: you are human, not a God, and you are going to fuck up from time to time, so why take any risks now that you are already established?

[Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) does not announce where he is going for the most part, even though he is followed by millions: he just shows up unannounced, and local believers whisper to one another in short advance and come to see him when possible.

As a result, there are almost no recordings of Li Hongzhi except from the early days when he actually had to go out and get new believers hooked himself.

What if he (brain-)farted during a presentation, like we all do from time to time? Don’t want recordings of that, do we? [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) related to those private presentations is only published after careful review of course.

<a name="vissarion"></a>**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Cv5hZfOmk&t=1177 Siberian Cult Leader Thinks He’s Jesus by VICE (2012) In this documentary, which VICE was allowed to visit and interview [Siberian](#russia-(俄罗斯)) prophet [Vissarion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vissarion) (real name Sergey Anatolyevitch Torop Серге́й Анато́льевич То́роп, AKA "The Russian Jesus"), and they note how well he controlled his appearance. Ciro also heard similar stories of [Stalin (斯大林, 1922-1952)](#stalin-(斯大林,-1922-1952)) and [Mao Zedong (毛泽东, 1954–1976)](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976)) when they would retreat from the public eye for a while. Part of appearance control generally requires you to select select [cult members of the inner circle](#membership-rivalry-(orange-papers,-让信徒免费长时间工作,-橙色文件)) to act for you, so you can minimize your surface of errors. This in exchange gives them greater status in the community.**

###### Different levels of truth (Orange Papers, 不同层次的真相, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160205090248/https://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q3.html#cq_levels_of_truth

And closely related: "Deceptive Recruiting"

Falun Gong people don’t talk freely about their funny beliefs like [aliens are amongst us](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) to outsiders.

Rather, they lure you in with the exercises first.

Ciro has personally heard the following said many times: "you should not tell this to non-believers, they are not ready for this truth yet".

Conversely, [dictatorships](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)), just like [cults](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)), also have practice different levels of truth, because in the end some level of decision maker has to know the actual truth of the world:

* [Brave New World books passage (美丽新世界的书籍段落, 1932)](#brave-new-world-books-passage-(美丽新世界的书籍段落,-1932))
* [Internal media of China (内参)](#internal-media-of-china-(内参))
* [Chernobyl 2019 miniseries (切尔诺贝利_(迷你剧))](#chernobyl-2019-miniseries-(切尔诺贝利_(迷你剧)))

Some other cults that come to mind:

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Philosophy_and_Economic_Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Philosophy_and_Economic_Science) just check that name. Sounds like a regular economy school, right?

###### Insistence that the group is THE ONLY WAY (Orange Papers, 坚持他们的团体是唯一的方式生活, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160203122607/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q1.html#cq_only_way

[Chinese "Communist" Party (CCP, 中国共产党, 1949-, Cult of Mao/Xi, 毛习邪教, 10.000 year Reich)](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich))'s version: [If you are against the CCP, then you are against China (如果你反对中共，那么你就是反对中国)](#if-you-are-against-the-ccp,-then-you-are-against-china-(如果你反对中共，那么你就是反对中国)).

###### No humour (Orange Papers, 不能有幽默, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185341/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q2.html#cq_no_humor

Basically exactly what is mentioned at [Funny (搞笑)](#funny-(搞笑)). Notably:

* making fun of [Xi Jinping (习近平, 2012-∞, Heil卐!)](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)) is not allowed for Chinese people
* making fun of [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) is not allowed for [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) believers

So we go ahead and make fun of both.

###### Promised Powers or Knowledge (Orange Papers, 应许的功能或知识, 橙色文件)

* "Promised Powers or Knowledge": https://web.archive.org/web/20160114213408/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q7.html#cq_promises
* "It’s a con. You don’t get the promised goodies": https://web.archive.org/web/20160114213408/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q7.html#cq_con

Many/most Falun Gong believers believe that:

* [Falun Gong has curative and general health benefits](#falun-gong-believers-are-less-likely-to-take-necessary-medication-(法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物))
* you will be saved in a soon-to-come-but-that-actually-never-really-comes [Judgement Day like event](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)
* some believers who practice really well can also get some "supernatural powers" (功能), but not everyone develops them. Luckily only so many people are that manipulable to believe they have obtained superpowers!

  But of course, you are [not allowed to just show your powers to other people, and most of all not to "ordinary people"](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)) of course, because "reasons"

  From [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_34.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_34.htm):

  > What will one develop in the course of his cultivation? He will develop supernatural powers which are called supernormal capabilities for short.
  >
  > Do you want to use them among ordinary people? You are absolutely not allowed to use them among ordinary people at will.

But in the end, since [everything is fake](#falun-gong-is-fake-(法轮功是假的)), there is only one reward that you can possibly get if you are both lucky and crazy hard working: [some attention from the master](#membership-rivalry-(orange-papers,-让信徒免费长时间工作,-橙色文件)).

* [Amazing Cultivation Simulator review by SsethTzeentach (2021) (了不起的修仙模拟器)](#amazing-cultivation-simulator-review-by-ssethtzeentach-2021)

###### Making cult members work long hours for free (Orange papers, 让信徒免费长时间工作, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200219/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q9.html#cq_work4free

Many Falun Gong members work long long hours for free to help spread their religion, either by:

* [preaching on the streets by giving out leaflets or demonstrating their exercise](#falun-gong-preaching-(法轮功传教))
* working for [Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体))

because spreading those are religious obligations.

But on the other hand, why wouldn’t do that if you believed that there is a [living god on our Earth which most "ordinary people" don’t know about](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), and that you are saving people’s souls? If a religion doesn’t make you do things for it, that belief is useless. In the case of Christianity however this is possibly in part linked to the [Evangelical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism) belief of [salvation by grace alone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_gratia). Quite convenient right, you don’t really have to do anything concrete to be saved, only believe and repent.

Furthermore, a very similar mindset is present in entrepreneurs, who are often driven to do long long work for an ideal. Sometimes, e.g. in [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))'s case, even to make [a not-for-profit](https://cirosantilli.com/ourbigbook-com).

And Ciro Santilli’s mother would spend countless hours helping the less fortunate after her retirement in activities semi-linked to her Protestant church.

So this point is not so simple to criticize.

But it is sad to watch people waste their lives [for something that is a lie](#falun-gong-is-fake-(法轮功是假的)).

###### Membership Rivalry (Orange papers, 让信徒免费长时间工作, 橙色文件)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132516/http://www.orange-papers.org/orange-cult_q7.html#cq_member_rivalry

While [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) hasn’t personally witnessed any malicious internal competition in Falun Gong, this does make the more interesting point that:

> Members vie with one another for the [guru](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))'s attention, and for status within the group. Everyone is trying to become part of the favored inner circle. The leader plays the members off against each other in order to maintain his hold over the cult.

and this is very true. Because since you, [everything is a lie](#falun-gong-is-fake-(法轮功是假的)) you [don’t get the promised goods](#promised-powers-or-knowledge-(orange-papers,-应许的功能或知识,-橙色文件)), and the only thing that is left for you to actually get is the guru’s attention and the social status associated with it.

The inner circle status mechanic is also closed related to [Careful control of your image (Orange Papers, 小心控制你的形象, 橙色文件)](#careful-control-of-your-image-(orange-papers,-小心控制你的形象,-橙色文件)), see the [Vissarion](#vissarion) video.

Some inner circle mechanics are also well shown in [Wild Wild Country (2017, 大师_(电影))](#wild-wild-country-(2017,-大师_(电影))) through Sheela.

### Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong

It appears that Falun Gong cannon is present at: https://falundafa.org/

The two main books are:

* "China Falun Gong" (中国法轮功) AKA just "Falun Gong" published in April 1993. 2006 English translation [https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006.htm](https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/flg_2006.htm). Wikipedia comments:

  > Falun Gong is an introductory book that discusses qigong, introduces the principles of the practice, and provides illustrations and explanations of the exercises.

  The first edition contains one of http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130###
* [Zhuan Falun (转法轮)](#zhuan-falun-(转法轮))

The initial versions of both of those texts contained versions of [Li Hongzhi's hagiography (李洪志的圣徒传记)](#li-hongzhi's-hagiography-(李洪志的圣徒传记)).

It contains [LHZ](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))'s approved texts/speech transcriptions, which are sacred.

The only sacred version is Chinese which is a [sacred language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_language), and of which there is only one perfect revision.

This is [perfectly analogous](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) to the role of:

* Arabic in Islam. Although Islam goes even further, and only the Arabic version can be recited in prayers. Non-Arabic-speakers have to just memorize sounds to perform Salah. https://nationalinterest.org/feature/plight-uyghurs-why-muslims-wont-speak-their-brethren-112466 suggests that this is a major reason why [Why don't many Islamic countries speak up for the Uyghur persecution? (为什么很多伊斯兰国家不反对维吾尔族迫害？)](#why-don't-many-islamic-countries-speak-up-for-the-uyghur-persecution?-(为什么很多伊斯兰国家不反对维吾尔族迫害？))
* Hebrew in Judaism

Protestants and later the Catholic church, have moved away from such really bad strategy however, the accessibility of Christianity is seen on the entrance of many many churches which have a sign "ALL are welcome". Perhaps this is also related to the fact that Christianism was already based on translating earlier Judaic texts to Greek, so the sacred language barrier was already broken. Well played.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) heard [LHZ](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) claims the specifically chose to reincarnate in China this last time.

The English translation is made by followers, and gets new revisions from time to time to reduce translation imperfections.

However, the Chinese language seems to be fundamentally sacred, and there might never be a sacred English version approved by LHZ.

LHZ is of course a de-facto God with superpowers, and can of course speak all languages, but [for reasons](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=for%20reasons) he didn’t just write an English translation himself.

This is a reasonable command to download the English cannon for grepping:

```
wget -r -l inf --no-remove-listing --no-clobber --no-parent -w 2 https://en.falundafa.org/falun-dafa-books.html
```

TODO: need to find a way to wrap lines, otherwise grep might fail on sentences.

But funnily the Canon books appear to all be copyrighted, likely "to avoid other people from modifying his sacred text", which is funny since the dude’s the voice of absolute truth of the universe, but you still gotta copyright that I guess.

Nothing else is canonical. LHZ seems to have said that there are enlightened followers, but has not specified who, so we can’t derive canon from anyone else.

Notably, [FLG media](#falun-gong-downplays-the-fact-that-it-is-highly-organized-(法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)) such as https://www.minghui.org/ is believer led and thus not canonical, even though believers have very high confidence in it, and LHZ [directly supports it](#falun-gong-downplays-the-fact-that-it-is-highly-organized-(法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)).

CCP [cult leaders](#ccp-cult-(中共邪教)) such as [Xi Jinping (习近平, 2012-∞, Heil卐!)](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)) and [Mao Zedong (毛泽东, 1954–1976)](#mao-zedong-(毛泽东,-1954–1976)) have also published their own canon books, e.g.:

* Xi’s: [Xi Jinping Thought (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想, 2017)](#xi-jinping-thought-(习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想,-2017))
* Mao’s: [Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (Little Red Book, 毛主席语录, 1976)](#quotations-from-chairman-mao-tse-tung-(little-red-book,-毛主席语录,-1976))

#### Zhuan Falun (转法轮)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachings_of_Falun_Gong#Zhuan_Falun,_the_main_book
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/转法轮_(书)

The main book of [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)).

Published in January 1995.

1998 English version: [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_01.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_01.htm):

According to Wikipedia:

> Zhuan Falun is the main teaching and the most comprehensive work; it is an edited version of Li’s nine-lecture series, 54 of which he taught across China between 1992 and 1994.

Believers very often read from this text when they ["study the Fa"](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) in their gatherings. They often read one chapter per session, and can often just say "we read the Nth teaching" (第N讲, so apparently each chapter corresponds to a separate talk). Just like [Xi Jinping Thought (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想, 2017)](#xi-jinping-thought-(习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想,-2017)) (and other Chinese religious traditions)!

**Front and back cover of [Zhuan Falun (转法轮)](#zhuan-falun-(转法轮)), first edition (1994).

### Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong, or just use it because it is censored? (三西猴是支持法轮功，还是仅仅因为它被审查而使用它？)

Ciro Santilli doesn’t support FLG specifically, only freedom of religion. See of course: [Does Ciro Santilli support Falun Gong just because his wife and mother-in-law do it? (三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)](#does-ciro-santilli-support-falun-gong-just-because-his-wife-and-mother-in-law-do-it?-(三西猴是否仅仅因为他的妻子和岳母就支持法轮功？)).

Ciro uses it in his usernames simply because it is the most banned and censored one in China today.

He believe that [individuals should only be put in jail for what they do, not for what they believe](#someone-from-movement-x-did-something-bad,-therefore-the-movement-should-be-banned-(x运动中的某个人做了坏事，因此该运动应该被禁止)).

He considers FLG [a religion like any other](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), and he is against its ban, as that of all other religions.

He also believes that freedom of speech and democracy imply that FLG and other religions will exist. If you want freedom, you have to [accept other people’s choices](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族)).

Otherwise, [democracy and communism can also be considered as religions](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)), and banned.

See also: [Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)).

### How is it like to live with Falun Gong believers? (与法轮功信徒一起生活是一种怎样的体验？)

This will obviously vary from believer to believer, but here is [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的))'s experience.

Like any other religion that is taken seriously, they spend several hours per week doing their standard religious activities: [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？).

Ciro has never seen them, or anyone we know from FLG say or do something that he consider morally incorrect because of FLG.

This does not prevent [his wife](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)) from working normally.

Ciro’s mother-in-law, who is retired, dedicates all her time to Falun Gong when she is not taking care of the house.

Ciro’s mother is also religious ([Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism)), and he gets a very similar feeling about both groups.

Like other religions, Falun Gong gives them meaning in life, and Ciro admires that they pursue their belief energetically, just as he persues his beliefs energetically.

Ciro much prefers that Ciro’s mother-in-law does Falun Gong, which is a noble meaningful goal, rather than watch stupid crap on television.

Also, although he is [agnostic](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong?-(三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)), Ciro also lives in a similar way.

Ciro’s religion is that of science and technology, and he pursue it fervently by trying to learn and teach it and spend several hours a week doing that, even when it does not give him money immediately.

If Ciro pursue his meaning, why should he prevent anyone from pursuing theirs?

Previously, Ciro’s wife and mother-in-law would sometimes try to persuade him to learn Falun Gong, which was annoying.

But every time he told them very clearly that he knows where to download the books if I want to, and that he may never want to read them, and that his wife must either accept this fact or leave him.

And they have accepted that: they think Ciro’s a good person, and they can accept that you can also be a good person even without doing Falun Gong.

Ciro does feel Falun Gong makes Ciro’s mother-in-law more reluctant to use or actively search for [medication or treatment](#falun-gong-believers-are-less-likely-to-take-necessary-medication-(法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物)). But he thinks it is also linked to the fact that she didn’t have a very good education or a good health system around. However, if Ciro and his wife give her something, she will take it. Ciro’s wife does not have any resistance to medication.

One thing that does worry Ciro is that Ciro’s mother in law sleeps too little every night, doing one of the Falun Gong meditations late in the evening, and then waking up very early to a long series of reading and exercise sessions. But it is hard to say if she would be any different without Falun Gong, it could just be her nature.

### Falun Gong is completely different in the West than it was in China (法轮功在西方与在中国完全不同)

I believe that it has changed.

But isn’t that the case of every cultural religious movement that migrates to a completely new culture?

Main points which may have changed:

* It has become more organized.

  But why shouldn’t they organize to defend themselves now that they have the chance without being put into prison?

  The CCP is highly organized and has way more resources.
* Less emphasis is given to the religious/mystical aspect, and more to the corporal exercises, and health aspect.

  This may be because people in the "West" are:

  * are "scientific-educated" atheists who wouldn’t go for a "religion"
  * already have other religions, which would view FLG as a taboo

Also maybe only the richest and most educated believers managed to escape China, and thus the movement carried that bias outside China.

If you know more ways in which it may have changed, let me know.

But once again, we can know nothing for sure about the past in China because of censorship.

Even if you saw something yourself, how can you be sure that it is representative?

And if it has changed, now that it has changed, maybe China should unban it?

### Falun Gong has been funded by the US government at least once, therefore it is evil (法轮功至少被美国政府资助过一次，所以是邪恶的)

1.5M USD in 2010 for a FLG controlled internet freedom group https://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8678760.stm

But well, if you are going to do something anyway, and someone offers you money, why wouldn’t you take it?

Taking the money does of course give a "bad impression" that someone is trying to buy influence, but does it in itself imply that you are doing something bad?

But do you really think that the US government paid that to buy influence in FLG? What would they force upon that FLG group that they didn’t already want to do? Isn’t it more likely that the US government wanted them to continue doing exactly what they were doing?

Every government funds groups it supports, it is an all out war I suppose. Compare that to the propaganda funds of the CCP.

What about the funding of political campaigns, which vastly outnumbers 1.5M USD every year?

### Falun Gong is illegal in China, we must follow the law (法轮功在中国是非法的，我们必须遵守法律)

If a law is unfair, we must fight to change it.

It was perfectly legal for [Nazis](#comparisons-between-the-ccp-and-nazi-germany-(纳粹德国和中共长得很想)) to kill Jews. Does it make that right?

But in the end, the commies don’t even bother passing or following laws, they just fuck people anyways without one: [Rule of law (法治)](#rule-of-law-(法治)).

The problem in [dictatorships](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)) is that the people have no power at all to change the law because there is no [Democracy (民主)](#democracy-(民主)).

The excuse that "we have to do this to follow Chinese law in order to operate in China", is exactly what all [Western companies that comply with Chinese censorship requests (遵守中国审查要求的西方公司)](#western-companies-that-comply-with-chinese-censorship-requests-(遵守中国审查要求的西方公司)) do. If Chinese law mandated killing Jews, they would likely comply.

The trick though is to delegate the dirty work to Chinese branches and employees, as a way to distance themselves from the activity. This is also generally a regulatory requirement of the Chinese government however.

### Falun Gong is fake (法轮功是假的)

The same can be argued about any other religion or political belief of type: it is better if we organize society in this or that way.

How can you disprove their belief, when as in any other religion, every affirmation made hinges on "miracles only happen around when true believers are around" or "only true believers can perceive evidence in their hearts / minds directly". He died of cancer or [Censorship of the 2019 Corona Virus (2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查))? Not a true believer, deep withing his heart, something was wrong. See also: [Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)](#falun-gong-never-makes-any-predictions-that-can-be-reasonably-verified-by-non-believers-(法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)).

Conversely, do you understand the full sequence of experiments that imply quantum field theory? Have you seen videos of those experiments? Have you attended live demonstrations? Do you understand the construction of the experimentation apparatus? Yet, why do you believe it?

Because millions of religious believers feel that they have have directly observed God/other dimensions/energies/aliens/some other religious crap through direct experience several times in their lieves, or even daily. Why then is quantum field theory correct, but their daily direct religious experience wrong?

More importantly: what do you propose that should be done about it? Should we kill followers? Or is jail enough?

Also do let me know when you have achieved irrefutable proof that democracy/freedom of speech are the optimal ways to organize the government: [Why does Ciro Santilli say that democracy is a religion just like Falun Gong? (为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)).

#### Falun Gong never makes any predictions that can be reasonably verified by non-believers (法轮功从不做任何非信徒可以合理验证的预言)

Exactly, just like any other [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), this is why [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) is [agnostic](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong?-(三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)) and thinks Falun Gong metaphysics is bullshit.

Notably, [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) explicitly forbids display of magical powers gained by believers to non-believers: [flg-supernatural-powers](#flg-supernatural-powers) for "reasons". What a convenient coincidence, that prevents any verifiability!

Just like in [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter), Falun Gong believers are part of the magical [Hogwarts world which non-believers, The Muggles](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), cannot access.

The closest claims to observable Ciro has heard are:

* when pictures are taken in sacred events, notably [Shen Yun Performing Arts (神韵艺术团, Falun Gong media)](#shen-yun-performing-arts-(神韵艺术团,-falun-gong-media)), sometimes you can see magic Falun energy wheels in the pictures
* in the homes of some followers, small magic good plants-like fungi-like things have grown

  <a name="flg-fungi"></a>**Image of the magic good small plants that grew on a [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) believer’s home.

They seem to identify those fungi as mini-[udumbaras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udumbara_(Buddhism)), which is just a fancy name that Buddhism scriptures use to refer to [cluster fig flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_racemosa) ([优昙婆罗](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/聚果榕), amongst a billion other existing phonetic transliterations) emphasising their magic properties.

* the [sacred books](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) of some believers had a closed lotus flower when they were bought, and after several years, the flower opened

but Ciro suspects they are not even [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), just believer oral culture.

Of course, like every other religion, reality happens to be is constructed in a way that prevents non-believers to verify anything with their eyes in a reproducible way.

Or a Jesus put it in [Luke 4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4&version=NIV):

> Then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
>
> "If you are the Son of God," he said, "throw yourself down. For it is written:
>
> "'He will command his angels concerning you,
>
> and they will lift you up in their hands,
>
> so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'"
>
> Jesus answered him, "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"

Ah good old [prophets](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), their tricks haven’t changed a bit in 2 thousand years! This is why [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) follows instead the religion of [science and freedom of speech](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)), because those religions instead say:

> Test your God. Test your God a billion times. And if your God proves wrong just once, disbelieve it.

The Pontius Pilate Scene from [The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)) comes to mind, quotes:

> Pontius: It’s also said that you do miracles? Is this good magic or bad magic? Can we have some sort of demonstration?
>
> Jesus: No, I’m not a trained animal, I’m not a magician.
>
> Pontius: Well, that’s disappointing. This means that you are just another Jewish politician.

and:

> Pontius: It’s one way to change the way that people live, but you want to change the way that they think and that they feel.
>
> Jesus: All I’m saying is the change will happen with love. Not with killing.
>
> Pontius: Either way it’s dangerous. It’s against Rome. It’s against the way the world is. In killing or loving, it’s all the same. It simply doesn’t matter how you want to change things, we don’t want them changed.

[Futurama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama) also has an interesting take:

In their talk, they comment on how "if as God you give them everything, they will grow dependent on you, and if you give them nothing, they will despise you". And so the best approach as a God might be "to influence things as if you weren’t there".**

### Many people both are against both censorship and Falun Gong (我要民主，但是我还要禁止法轮功)

Ciro know that, and that supporting FLG is "bad" for his public image with most Chinese, including those that are against censorship.

But [without censorship, there will be democracy](#would-ending-the-great-firewall-truly-end-the-dictatorship?-(结束防火墙真的会结束独裁吗？)), and with democracy FLG followers will have voting rights, and FLG will become legal.

Ciro thinks that the situation is very similar to [Scientology](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) in the USA today: most people dislike it, but believe that you can believe whatever you want.

Democracy and Communism [can also be considered as religions and persecuted](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)).

Isn’t it convenient when a dictatorship gets rid of those weirdos for you? But not so much when suddenly you or your family is the weirdo...

If you are not ready to accept the beliefs of others, dictatorship is the only choice for you.

It is also interesting to note how Falun Gong is a good source of [Censorship circumvention (翻墙, 科学上网)](#censorship-circumvention-(翻墙,-科学上网)) material.

See also:

#### Why does Ciro Santilli say that democracy is a religion just like Falun Gong? (为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)

Because it also specifies irrational and fundamental aspects of how one should live, notably voting and freedom of speech.

Just like the [CCP cult (中共邪教)](#ccp-cult-(中共邪教)) has one fundamental belief: [the Party is always right](#if-anyone-disagrees-with-the-government-they-must-be-punished-to-keep-the-stability-of-the-country-(如果有人不同意政府，他们必须受到惩罚以保持国家的稳定)).

Ban [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)), and you have banned democracy.

Accept democracy, and you will have [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)).

There is no in-between.

#### Falun Gong had to be banned because it was a threat to the stability of the country (法轮功必须被取缔，因为它威胁到国家的稳定)

Then they link to the Taping Rebellion:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Rebellion
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiping_Heavenly_Kingdom

Of course FLG was a threat to the stability of the country.

It is, as [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) has said, a highly organized political power: [People from movement X are only in it for political power (X运动的人只是为了政治权力)](#people-from-movement-x-are-only-in-it-for-political-power-(x运动的人只是为了政治权力)).

However, [democracy](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-democracy-is-a-religion-just-like-falun-gong?-(为什么三西猴说民主就像法轮功一样是一种宗教？)) is a threat to the stability country in the exact same way:

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution

Anything that goes against a dictatorship is a threat to the stability of the country.

Now read: [If anyone disagrees with the government they must be punished to keep the stability of the country (如果有人不同意政府，他们必须受到惩罚以保持国家的稳定)](#if-anyone-disagrees-with-the-government-they-must-be-punished-to-keep-the-stability-of-the-country-(如果有人不同意政府，他们必须受到惩罚以保持国家的稳定))

### Many people say they do Falun Gong only to get VISAs to the USA (很多人说他们修炼法轮功只是为了拿到美国签证)

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) heard this a few times, and I believe it has happened.

But I don’t see how this is relevant at all to this discussion:

* if they are not really FLG believers, they should be prosecuted, but this says nothing about the real FLG believers,
* if they are, then why wouldn’t they seek a VISA, since they are in constant threat of going to jail or worse in China, and the USA law gives them that right?

Sample news:

* https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/09/28/652218318/thousands-could-be-deported-as-government-targets-asylum-mills-clients

### I have personally seen people do bad things because of Falun Gong

Either direct suicide or [dying because of not taking medication](#falun-gong-believers-are-less-likely-to-take-necessary-medication-(法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物)).

First, I’m not saying I don’t believe you, and I’m sorry about what happened.

But your testimony is worthless unless you give the following:

* clear unique personal identification

  This is because the CCP has thousands of [wumaos](#wumao-(五毛)) who could make fake reports.

  There are basically two ways to do that:

  1. your testimony is done in video form on YouTube clearly showing your face as you make it
  2. links between a notable social media presence that is hard to achieve, e.g. Twitter with many followers, Stack overflow with a lot of rep, and the account

     Either of those must contain / link to information that uniquely identifies you. Generally, full name, city and date of birth is enough.
* a precise testimony that states exactly what you saw happen with your own eyes, or heard from people that are very close to you.

  The testimony must include:

  * when the events happened
  * where they happened, in which city at the very least
  * the full names of who did what

  This is to:

  * make it easier to verify the truth of the event
  * uniquely identify the event so we don’t count a single event multiple times

If you do provide all of the above, I add your report to a list of reports that I will maintain. This list does not exist yet because there were no valid reports yet.

Next consider this:

* are you sure that Falun Gong made the person do the bad thing, and that the person wouldn’t have done it anyway?

  Did someone from Falun Gong told the person to do it?

  I bet that if you look into patients of psychiatrists, you will find more suicides than average. So should we ban psychiatry?
* are you sure that the order came from [LHZ](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), and that it was not just some disgruntled local leader using Falun Gong for his personal madness and doing things he did not approve?

  Branch Davidians were inspired by [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教)). So should we ban Christianity? What about the majority of Christians who have never done anything bad?
* only statistics have any meaning, and it would require a very large number of reports to make up statistics, so you will likely be wasting your time. I will do my part and maintain a list however.
* if we ask for FLG believers to compile a list of horrors they have suffered, which they have already been doing since the start of the persecution, I bet that their list will be much longer than yours, because they are so [well organized](#falun-gong-downplays-the-fact-that-it-is-highly-organized-(法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实))

### Falun Gong does not have proof of their persecution claims (法轮功没有被迫害的证据)

How much proof do you think they would be able to get when there is no freedom of the press?

Do you think that forbidding a [70 million](#why-is-it-important-to-discus-falun-gong's-even-if-you-don't-believe-in-it?-(为什么不信仰法轮功也很重要要讨论它？)) person religion could have gone smoothly?

Do you think the thousands of personal accounts of human rights violations that exist are all fake, and don’t indicate that many, many more have taken place but fallen under censorship?

Conversely, there is no reliable proof that FLG is bad as claimed by CCP that has been verified by international media.

#### Western media has exaggerated reports on Falun Gong for propaganda reasons (西方媒体以宣传为由夸大法轮功报道)

Possibly true, but which reports are you talking about specifically?

All that I care about is:

* it is censored today
* if you do it you go to jail
* there were tens of millions of followers at the time of the ban

which I think are undeniable.

The only question that matters is: should it be banned or not?

And as usual: [Censorship makes no one trust your country (审查使得沒有人相信你的国家)](#censorship-makes-no-one-trust-your-country-(审查使得沒有人相信你的国家)), so which reports can we trust more?

### Someone from movement X did something bad, therefore the movement should be banned (X运动中的某个人做了坏事，因此该运动应该被禁止)

By this logic, everyone should go to jail. The law should only punish individuals.

The communist party, which has had continuous power since 1949, killed millions during the [Cultural Revolution (文化大革命, 1966-1976)](#cultural-revolution-(文化大革命,-1966-1976)). Surely they must be banned, no?

But the CCP has changed so much since those days, [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) hears you say.

Ciro agrees. And [so has Falun Gong](#falun-gong-is-completely-different-in-the-west-than-it-was-in-china-(法轮功在西方与在中国完全不同)).

As mentioned at [Is Falun Gong a cult? (法轮功是邪教吗？)](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)), Ciro Santilli does consider Falun Gong a peaceful cult, unlike Aum. But even then, Ciro is against the loss of rights of Aum members that were never convicted of any crime, and were possibly also not aware of any crimes that were committed, as shown in this documentary.**

#### Movement X tells people to do something bad, therefore the movement should be banned (运动X告诉人们做坏事，因此运动应该被禁止)

E.g. kill.

Yes, convincing someone to do something bad is as bad as doing it yourself of course, and must be forbidden.

Now proceed to prove that FLG made and will continue making people do bad things, going through:

This has been one of the major anti-Falun Gong propaganda pieces by the CCP, and one of the most refuted by Falun Gong propaganda even as of 2020.

Li Hongzhi’s literature maintains that suicide is very bad for you, e.g.: from 2003 [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20030420L.html

  > Question: Some people can’t give up Dafa, but also can’t let go of their humanness. On the surface they are cultivating and doing some Fa-rectification things, but they are in fact stirring up trouble and creating disturbances, with some even committing suicide or being gay. What will become of these people? Will they go to the dimension of demons? And what will happen to those who stick up for them?
  >
  > Teacher: I know about all of that. Unless I have absolutely no choice I don’t want to expel them, so I’m observing and watching these things. It’s best that these people, if they want to do themselves justice, wake up quickly--wake up quickly! If you’re determined to do that, then tell Dafa disciples about the things you’ve done, and that could help. Time is running short. I’m really worried about you. Don’t take Master’s mercy so lightly. The Fa has standards.

  and from 1998 canon https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980329L.html

###### Honour suicides in Chinese history (中国历史上的荣誉自杀, Qu Yuan, 屈原, Wu Zixu, 伍子胥)

As [mentioned on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_in_China&oldid=992138770#History), China has a long history of suicide for altruistic/moral/honour reasons in Confucian tradition, some of which are still celebrated to this day.

The [Analects (论语, c. 475-200 BC)](#analects-(论语,-c.-475-200-bc)) paragraph [15.9](#analects-translation-by-robert-eno-2015) says:

> The Master said, The gentleman who is resolute and ren does not seek to live on at the expense of ren, and there are times when he will sacrifice his life to complete ren.

[Mencius (book, 孟子 (书), c. 300 BC)](#mencius-(book,-孟子-(书),-c.-300-bc)) paragraph [paragraph 6A.10](#mencius-translation-by-robert-eno-2016) says:

> I love to eat fish; I also love to eat bear paws. If I can’t have both, I will forego the fish and eat the bear paws. I love life; I also love right. If I can’t have both, I will forego life and choose to do right. Life is truly something I love, it is just that there is something else I love more, and so I can’t hold on to life by devious means. And death is truly something I hate, it is just that there is something I hate more than death, and so there are dangers I will not avoid.
>
> If a man loves nothing more than life, then won’t he use whatever means are required to hold onto it? If a man hates nothing more than death, then won’t he use whatever means are required to avoid danger? Yet there are things men won’t do in order to avoid danger and live, and from this we know that there are things men love more than life and hate more than death. It is not just worthy men who have such feelings, all men have them; worthies are simply those who do not lose them.

Notable historical figures who committed suicides are are still celebrated to this day include:

* [Qu Yuan (屈原, 340-278 BC)](#qu-yuan-(屈原,-340-278-bc))
* [Wu Zixu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Zixu) ([伍子胥](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/伍子胥), ???-484 BC)

These sound exactly like examples that [Xi Dada (习大大, 2015)](#xi-dada-(习大大,-2015)) would want his army to keep in mind: ultimate sacrifice for the motherland.

###### Qu Yuan (屈原, 340-278 BC)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qu_Yuan
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/屈原

He is celebrated in the [Dragon Boat Festival (端午节, Double Fifth Festival, 重五节)](#dragon-boat-festival-(端午节,-double-fifth-festival,-重五节)), the third most important festival in modern China.

Held during the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.

He committed suicide by drowning himself in the [Miluo River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miluo_River), modern [Hubei Province (湖北省)](#hubei-province-(湖北省)), while holding a rock, after his country’s ([Chu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chu_(state)) ([楚国](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/楚国))) capital was taken by the Qin enemies during the [Warring States period (战国时期, 475-221 BC)](#warring-states-period-(战国时期,-475-221-bc)).

He is a symbol of patriotism respected to this day.

A reference to one of his poems appears e.g. at [Hu Yaobang’s memorial](#hu-yaobang-memorial) in [Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 (六四事件)](#tiananmen-square-protests-of-1989-(六四事件)).

### People from movement X are only in it for political power (X运动的人只是为了政治权力)

For every desire of the masses, there will be amoral representatives that will step to use that power.

Still, those representatives cannot gain power if there is no backing desire from society.

The only advantage of [democracy](#why-would-democracy-and-freedom-of-speech-make-china-richer?-(为什么民主和言论自由能够让中国变得更加富有？)), is that those representatives have to pretend harder to do things for that group to retain their power.

Falun Gong believers obviously have the right to do politics, just like any other person, and Ciro greatly encourages this.

But Ciro does not like that Falun Gong tends to not call itself a political force, when it clearly is. But full disclosure is not a legal obligation, and many many media outlets don’t really disclose their obvious political connections. See also: [Falun Gong media is not transparent about its affiliation (法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)](#falun-gong-media-is-not-transparent-about-its-affiliation-(法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)).

Falun Gong directly contacts Government officials, [demonstrates in front of government buildings](http://www.clearharmony.net/articles/a25124-European-Falun-Gong-Practitioners-held-an-Anti-torture-Exhibition-during-the-European-Union-Meeting-in-France.html#.XyHSa2OYWV4) and [supports Trump](#falun-gong-supports-donald-(trump,-法轮功支持特朗普)), how can that not be politics?!?! Just call it for what it is, and no one will be able to criticize you for it!

[Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) directly says that FLG should not be involved in politics in [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), e.g. [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/jjyz52.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/jjyz52.htm):

> Never get involved in politics, nor interfere with state affairs'.

But at the same, he also greatly encourages [Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体)), which obviously a political influence method. As usual, everything in Falun Gong is explained in an indirect roundabout way.

Other related canon mentions https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2003/3/21/33575.html "Explaining the Fa During the 2003 Lantern Festival at the U.S. West Fa Conference":

> Question: When elections were held in our district, there were people who went to help a few congressional candidates that supported Dafa. But some people thought we shouldn’t get ourselves involved in politics, and that we shouldn’t rely on ordinary people to do things for Dafa. Is that understanding correct?
>
> Teacher: It’s correct in principle, but for this specific matter you should look at it this way. If you say Dafa disciples can’t get involved in ordinary society’s politics, I wouldn’t say that’s 100% correct. What I told you was that Dafa doesn’t get involved in politics. And a lot of our Dafa disciples work in politics, that’s their job. So if there’s a government election, should you take part in it? If you take part in it and cast your vote, well then you’ve gotten involved in politics. A Dafa disciple cultivating in the ordinary society means that you try your best to cultivate while conforming to the ordinary society, and then there won’t be a problem. You, too, are a member of the ordinary society. And the existence of the ordinary society is necessary for Dafa, for the cosmos, and for sentient beings. We can only help maintain it and can’t disrupt it. When you’re supposed to vote, just go vote, that’s not a problem. If you say that a certain Congressman is your personal friend, and you’d like to help him do something, then of course there might be things that involve elections and you’d be doing volunteer work—that doesn’t matter. But our Dafa as a whole doesn’t get involved in politics, and we can’t do anything political in the name of Dafa. For Dafa disciples, validating the Fa should be the priority, though.
>
> The last time there was an election in Taiwan, I had a veteran practitioner call the person in charge of the Taiwan Dafa Association and make it clear to the public that Dafa Associations take no stance on elections. If an individual practitioner wants to support someone, that’s his personal business and it doesn’t represent Dafa. There were Dafa disciples supporting both of the parties. The Falun Dafa Association has no political opinion regarding any party’s election, and it doesn’t get involved. As individual practitioners you can support whoever you’d like. That’s how it works.

The last paragraph is really great, as it indicates how Li’s communication works. His top tenants are known, and their word is as good as the master’s.

[https://en.falundafa.org/eng/lectures/20040412L.html](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/lectures/20040412L.html) also has some good quotes:

> Question: During Taiwan’s presidential election, some students' human attachments got stirred up. Was it a test arranged by the old forces? What’s the right way for us to handle this?
>
> Teacher: Even if the sky were to fall, a cultivator’s righteous thoughts would stay unshaken--that is cultivation, and that is remarkable. (Applause) A cultivator is not attached to anything in this world. Dafa disciples' cultivation takes a different form today. In cultivation you do your best out in the world to conform to ordinary society, you have normal jobs in ordinary society, and you have your families, jobs, and all that--you are closely tied to society. With the Taiwan election, some students thought a certain person was pretty good and so they wanted to vote for him, while others thought a different person was pretty good and wanted to vote for that one. People have their own, different views, and there’s nothing wrong with that. A person’s own actions out in society don’t represent Dafa. But you can’t be attached to those things the way ordinary people are.
>
> Whoever you vote for, I can’t, as your Master, say that you’re wrong, nor do I get involved in those things. That’s because the path I ask you to take has you cultivate in ordinary society. Cultivators can only benefit a society. You cultivate in ordinary society but you don’t steer human society in one direction or another.
>
> So for each student, it’s fine for you to vote as an individual for whomever you want. It’s just that you can’t be too attached. But through the persecution against Dafa disciples in Mainland China, Dafa disciples have seen through something, and so some are thinking, "Whoever is close to the evil that’s persecuting us, I won’t vote for him." (Applause) And as your Master I have no objection to that either. (Audience laughs, applauds) Those are the students' own thoughts, and as your Master I haven’t told you who to vote for. Still less will I tell you to take any group action, and that’s not allowed. (Audience laughs)

**https://youtu.be/ArfGyo6HQ_E?t=1175 Ciro really liked what [Doctor Matthew N. Schmalz](https://www.holycross.edu/academics/programs/religious-studies/faculty/mathew-schmalz) said on this VICE documentary about [Hyung Jin Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyung_Jin_Moon)'s and his [Unification movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_movement) ("the Moonies" split-off religion. "I think that any new religion needs a constituency. And especially for a group that is new, that is relatively small, making connections with other groups that might have similar commitments is something that can be quite productive if you are a leader of a new religion". As long as everyone plays the democracy game through democracy rules, peace tends to be maintained, and it is easier for multiple different beliefs to coexist. Falun Gong has obviously gone in this political direction, and that is a positive sign about the religion.**

#### Falun Gong supports Donald (Trump, 法轮功支持特朗普)

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) believes without non-circumstantial evidence that the huge majority of Falun Gong believers strongly supports Trump.

Ciro feels that Falun Gong’s support of Trump is a fundamental religious issue to the group.

Falun Gong seems to believe that Trump is perfect and that everything that he says is true and good. He is essentially a supernatural force of good, as well shown at: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaWjFeo0BgU You Are Not Alone by Tony Chen Music (陳東音樂, 2020) is a timeless classic devotional Trump support song. by Tony who [is a Falun Gong believer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AZ-jCiXCpI). This is consistent with Ciro’s understanding of FLG’s view of the world, where [](#!falun-gong-believes-that-the-ccp-is-literally-a-manifestation-of-real-devils) ("I see the true light - You are the Chosen One to fight the Red Demon") and therefore Trump is the manifestation of a supernatural force oof Good. The Chinese version is even more open about Trump’s God-like status: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZrVbX8jV_o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZrVbX8jV_o), and contains perls such as (official translation) "I see hope - you are the Chosen One to save the world" and "Trump, Trump, you are not alone! Gods and Buddhas are here with you!". The extensive use of Trump’s slogan "Make America great again" is also in line with Falun Gong’s belief that the world was Good before, but has become Evil today. [](#!epoch-times) made a [profile of Tony in 2018](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/18/2/1/n10105396.htm).](#you-are-not-alone-by-tony-chen-music). And his opponents, e.g. Biden and the Left, are the opposite.

Like everything else concrete, it is not clear if [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) has directly supported this or not.

Ciro feels without proof however that it is extremely likely that he has given very clear private directives to his top tenants to support Trump, notably to the heads of the key [Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体)) organizations.

And then this belief gets pumped endlessly through the Falun Gong media, which completely unilaterally praises and supports Trump and criticizes his opponents, so that all believers understand that this is Li Hongzhi’s desire.

Edit: around 2021-05-15, this got published on [Minghui (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#minghui-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media)): [https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2021/5/18/大纪元新唐人媒体法会讲法-425888.html](https://www.minghui.org/mh/articles/2021/5/18/大纪元新唐人媒体法会讲法-425888.html). It is not on [falundafa.org](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) yet, but is extremely likely to be uploaded later and can already be consiered canon. The title is "Fa Teachings at the [The Epoch Times (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#the-epoch-times-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media))/[New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD, NTDTV, 新唐人電視台, Falun Gong media)](#new-tang-dynasty-television-(ntd,-ntdtv,-新唐人電視台,-falun-gong-media)) media meeting", and it contains the first, unumbiguous support of Trump done in Canon. Although such support took a long time to come out publicly in canon, [which ciro-santilli condems](#falun-gong-media-is-not-transparent-about-its-affiliation-(法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)), it was a huge positive step forward towards transparency, as it makes Falun Gong’s pre-exising but unannounced religious support for Donald trump publicly official. The key quote on Google Translate is:

> Everyone knows that the former president of the United States could not be re-elected, and he was taken down by improper means. I only talk about this phenomenon. Isn’t it a manifestation of the current state of society? Everyone knows that the former president wants to talk about traditions and restore traditions. What he has to do is to change the moral quality of people and society in a better direction, and to restore society to a better social state. Is he going against the current heavenly principle? Because God’s law is not working. Is he against the trend of this society? He is going against the current, and he wants to suffocate the current. If it’s a country, maybe he can do it; what about the entire human society, it’s too difficult. So, if the entire universe is like this, can it be intercepted? Unstoppable. So, those gods who took him down and those bad gods in the old universe were as timid as they had stolen things in their hearts. They knew what he was doing was good. Do not you know? all know. Although those gods are corrupt, at least he still understands these things

which therefore clearly says Trump is a manifestation of supernatural forces of good, and also clearly says that the 2020 American election was in fact [stolen by the Democrats as per Donald Trump’s accusations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election).

It could have been even more direct, but [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) considers this more than direct enough. A Brazillian saying comes to mind: "Para bom entendedor, meia palavra basta" (For the Connoisseur/Expert, half a word is enough). This was notably used as part of an relentless advertisement campaign when Ciro was young (certainly too young to drink) for the overly-long-named beer brand [Schincariol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brasil_Kirin), suggesting that you could just call is "schin", e.g. to order it at a bar. Sample ad: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-UWr1RIQU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-UWr1RIQU). Anyways, back to Falun Gong, when it is the word of [Living God himself](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), even a quarter-word is enough I guess.

Prior to that, the most direct public suggestion we can find that Li Hongzhi directly supported Trump was in 2020-11-08 https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/20/11/8/n12534746.htm when the [The Epoch Times (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#the-epoch-times-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media)) published a poem by [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) which Ciro believes is clearly directly supporting Trump, since it was released just after Trump was announced to have lost the presidential elections, amidst claims of electoral fraud under investigation, which Falun Gong media fully and completely supported. The official translation can be found in [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) [https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20201108A.html](https://en.falundafa.org/eng/articles/20201108A.html):

> On the General Election
>
> In this majestic universe, the communist devil is making trouble\
> Fraud and corruption are harming a great nation\
> All the machinations make people only more despondent\
> When will justice be upheld and our conscience restored? +
>
> Hongzhi Li\
> November 8, 2020

To be completely fair, Trump has been vocal about China’s threat way before [COVID](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)), and correctly so in Ciro’s opinion, and therefore is a much needed ally of the Falun Gong movement, and to anyone that opposes China’s threat, like Ciro does.

Furthermore, Ciro does believe that there might be a Democrat bias to media, and that certainly [social media like Twitter should never ever censor any political statements as it has done for Trump](#western-democracies-also-censor-subjects-such-as-child-porn-and-hate-speech-(西方民主国家也审查儿童色情和仇恨言论等主题)).

And of course, so long as those pro-Trump campaigns respect the laws of the country, Falun Gong is free to do it and must not be interfered with. As if other major American media didn’t have political agendas: [USA-based media bias](#usa-based-media-bias).

This is exactly the same, in fact, as to how [religious affiliation](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？) has a huge impact in how the average American votes: [https://theconversation.com/how-strong-a-role-does-religion-play-in-us-elections-133224](https://theconversation.com/how-strong-a-role-does-religion-play-in-us-elections-133224).

It seems that Trump’s immigration policies have turned Asian Americans towards the democrat opposition however as of 2019: [https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/13/18308137/asian-american-voters-immigration-democrats-donald-trump](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/13/18308137/asian-american-voters-immigration-democrats-donald-trump).

One saving point of the republicans for Asians is the opposition to university quotas instance, which many Asians feel blocks their high performing kids from top schools for less deserving students. This is suggested for example at: https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/yang-asian-americans-affirmative-action/605917/ "Opposition to affirmative action was pulling Asians toward the GOP. Then Yang’s campaign began to gather momentum."

Examples:

* NBC News claims that the [The Epoch Times (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#the-epoch-times-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media)) has donated to Trump propaganda: $1.5 million https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/trump-qanon-impending-judgment-day-behind-facebook-fueled-rise-epoch-n1044121
* after the [2020 United States presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election), [Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体)) such as [The Epoch Times (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#the-epoch-times-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media)) was one of the very few medias to not immediately dismiss [Trump’s accusations of electoral fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election), as baseless e.g. on 2020-12-12 https://web.archive.org/web/20201212014230/https://www.theepochtimes.com/ the front page read "Election outcome unclear amid legal challenges", at which point most had been shot down. And earlier their editorial had clarified [https://web.archive.org/web/20201107223813/https://www.theepochtimes.com/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201107223813/https://www.theepochtimes.com/) "Why The Epoch Times Won’t Call the Presidential Race Until All Challenges Are Resolved".
  * 2020-12-16 consider this sample [New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD, NTDTV, 新唐人電視台, Falun Gong media)](#new-tang-dynasty-television-(ntd,-ntdtv,-新唐人電視台,-falun-gong-media)) screenshot of the latest videos published at the time: [https://archive.vn/Sxn8m](https://archive.vn/Sxn8m), where it can be seen that about 80-90% of the videos are supporting Trump’s electoral fraud claims.

    While Ciro agrees that reporting such events impartially is important and has merit, the fact that so few medias took the lawsuits seriously at all is still indicative of their strong Trump support.

    Ciro is also extremely opposed to censorship of such viewpoints, as done by YouTube, as mentioned at [Fake news (假新闻)](#fake-news-(假新闻)), when they started taking down any videos that upheld the electoral fraud viewpoint.
* [Me and Li by Ben Hurley (2017)](#me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-(2017)) says how after his conversion to Falun Gong:

  > My social beliefs had transformed from those typical of a left-leaning family to take on a very conservative hue.

Other election/politics related [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) mentions [Fa Teaching at the 2019 New York Fa Conference](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2019/6/2/177872.html):

> Question: Misleading news is everywhere in this Internet age, and it’s often hard to tell real news from fake. In the upcoming Taiwan and U.S. general elections in 2020, will fake news cloud people’s judgment?
>
> Master: Degenerate things are common in this troubled world, and it’s hard to accomplish good things. That’s how things are in a troubled world. Many people didn’t expect Trump to be elected in the last U.S. election, but he was. Some people believe that things are supposed to go a certain way, but then they turn out otherwise. I have always said that divine beings are in control of human affairs, and that it is they who have the say. But if I speak too much about it or get into the specifics, it might negatively impact our saving people, so I won’t go into it.

As usual, Hongzhi beats round the bush, as per [Different levels of truth (Orange Papers, 不同层次的真相, 橙色文件)](#different-levels-of-truth-(orange-papers,-不同层次的真相,-橙色文件)). Ciro feels it [would be better for Falun Gong if he just publicly said that believers must support Trump](#falun-gong-media-is-not-transparent-about-its-affiliation-(法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)).

One wonders how Falun Gong views Trump’s ideology of "[grabbing them by the pussy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Access_Hollywood_tape)". But sure, that was in 2005, he must have converted to Good since.

The extensive use of Trump’s slogan "Make America great again" is also in line with Falun Gong’s belief that the world was Good before, but has become Evil today.

### Does Ciro Santilli believe in the allegations of human rights violations done to Falun Gong believers?

Besides the obvious prohibition of their most fundamental belief, so e.g. being tortured.

Let’s just focus on the evidence:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CedVnJOgwg4 "Undercover video reveals brutal treatment of Falun Gong prisoners inside Chinese labor camps" by "FOX 11 Los Angeles" published May 21, 2019. Names mentioned: Fuquan Yin,

#### Does Ciro Santilli believe in the allegations of organ harvesting made by Falun Gong believers?

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_harvesting_from_Falun_Gong_practitioners_in_China
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/對中國共產黨摘取法輪功學員及良心犯器官的指控

In short: Ciro believes that it has happened to many people.

Long version follows.

It is obviously very hard to prove and quantify it definitely, much like it was hard to prove the Holocaust: bodies were cremated, and bribes were paid.

Even if we had a video showing the whole process, showing the whole money flow from the donor to the prison guard, it would still be hard to quantify it, so I do have some room for doubt in this opinion.

But consider the following, which is based on what Ciro has heard.

Even Chinese officials have admitted that in the past, if the body of the executed person is not claimed by family, then the organs can be extracted even without the consent of the prisoner:

* 2014-12-04 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-30324440 "China to stop harvesting executed prisoners' organs"
* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/07/china-still-using-executed-prisoners-organs-transplants-vatican
* https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-the-face-of-criticism-china-has-been-cleaning-up-its-organ-transplant-industry/2017/09/14/d689444e-e1a2-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html

Perhaps now that they claim that there is a large voluntary organ donor database, then this has stopped or been reduced, but let’s focus on that period when the extractions were widely done.

From this, even though China does not publish execution statistics, we can imagine that a large part of the organs come from prisoners sentenced to death.

Then, consider that a [70 million](#why-is-it-important-to-discus-falun-gong's-even-if-you-don't-believe-in-it?-(为什么不信仰法轮功也很重要要讨论它？)) person religion was banned, leading to a huge influx of prisoners from that religion.

FLG followers are just de-facto criminals like any other, and so extracting their organs is also de-facto legal.

Also, people from that religion don’t drink alcohol, smoke or take drugs, and their organs are of good quality.

Furthermore, FLG prisoners continue to not bow down to the government even in prison, e.g. by doing their [Falun Gong meditation](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), which makes them clearly identifiable and dangerous to the system.

Finally, add to that mix the [huge level of corruption found in dictatorships](#democracies-have-less-corruption-than-dictatorships-(民主国家的腐败比独裁国家少)).

Don’t you think, then, that it is extremely likely that it has happened many times that such people have been selected to be executed earlier than others on average, due to the monetary value of their organs?

##### 2018 China Tribunal

2018 https://chinatribunal.com/

This is a mock tribunal, i.e. one without any power of law, and was of course initially lobbied/organized brought up by FLG: https://endtransplantabuse.org/

However, Ciro Santilli believes that none of the lawyers/jury members are Falun Gong believers, and that they are trying to honestly decide if there is enough evidence or not for organ harvesting in China.

They also have non-FLG witnesses.

Whether you believe in their partiality or not, I highly recommend watching some of what the witnesses, which I find very convincing and informative:

* https://youtu.be/oW3IaaXWE8s?t=7225 Swedish man who spent several years in prison in China

A notable precursor to mock tribunals is the [Russel Tribunal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Tribunal).

### Things Ciro Santilli dislikes about Falun Gong (三西猴不喜欢法轮功的事情)

But also as explaining why I don’t think it justifies the ban.

This section also gives me more credibility as a balanced critic >:-)

* [Falun Gong downplays the fact that they are a religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？)

#### Falun Gong downplays the fact that it is highly organized (法轮功淡化了它高度组织化的事实)

Many FLG practitioners claim that they are not at all organized, or that they have no political interest, and I truly believe that they mean it.

But it is obvious from the size of the [Falun Gong media (法轮功媒体)](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体)), namely:

* [New Tang Dynasty Television (NTD, NTDTV, 新唐人電視台, Falun Gong media)](#new-tang-dynasty-television-(ntd,-ntdtv,-新唐人電視台,-falun-gong-media))
* [The Epoch Times (明慧网, Falun Gong media)](#the-epoch-times-(明慧网,-falun-gong-media)) newspaper
* [Shen Yun Performing Arts (神韵艺术团, Falun Gong media)](#shen-yun-performing-arts-(神韵艺术团,-falun-gong-media)) dance troupe

that in practice they do have are a highly organized hierarchical structure, and very likely with [LHZ](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) at the very top, e.g.:

* Shen Yun’s 2018 libretto says that their Artistic Director and founder is "D.F." (likely an abbreviation for Da Fa, which is an abbreviation for Falun Gong Dafa, which is a full name of Falun Gong), with a picture of LHZ on top. It also amusingly says that D.F. is a "Distinguished Professor of Music and Dance at Fei Tian College in New York", which is likely where many of Shen Yun’s dancers are trained, and therefore controlled by himself to a large extent. It’s Falun Gong’s dance-only-for-now [BYU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young_University).
* LHZ mentions NDTV, Epoch Times and Shen Yun extensively on his [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)). TODO link to source, this based on unintentionally overhearing to my family members reading it.

Furthermore, Falun Gong practitioners directly lobby foreign governments to take action against human rights abuses in China, e.g.:

* https://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+MOTION+P7-RC-2013-0562+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN
* https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-court-cisco-must-be-held-accountable-aiding-chinas-human-rights-abuses

Like any other religion, they have all the right to take those actions, and it is definitely in their best interest, and perhaps in the best interest of the whole world, that they do so.

The only thing that annoys me is their lack of self perception on this matter: the large majority of Western people would definitely classify them as an organized political force after having observed their activities. When they say otherwise, they are hurting their own credibility.

##### Falun Gong media is not transparent about its affiliation (法轮功媒体对其隶属关系不透明)

Agreed, and it is a point that hurts more than helps their cause.

This is very clearly put as well at "Front groups" of the [Orange Papers (橙色文件)](#orange-papers-(橙色文件)).

But the media is not legally obliged to state their affiliation.

And if that were the case, then we should force _all_ newspapers to start taking polls of how many employees follow which religion and support which political party, and then put that in their print.

But [Xinhua News Agency (新华通讯社, 新华社, CCP media)](#xinhua-news-agency-(新华通讯社,-新华社,-ccp-media)) is learning well from this, e.g. [New China TV](#new-china-tv).

#### Falun Gong dislikes several other groups like homosexuals and some other religions (法轮功不喜欢其他几个群体，如同性恋者和其他一些宗教)

Like most [old religions](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), related: [Western democracies also censor subjects such as child porn and hate speech (西方民主国家也审查儿童色情和仇恨言论等主题)](#western-democracies-also-censor-subjects-such-as-child-porn-and-hate-speech-(西方民主国家也审查儿童色情和仇恨言论等主题)).

[Canon quote](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) from [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980904L.html](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980904L.html):

> Question: Why is homosexuality considered immoral?
>
> Teacher: Think about it, everyone: Is homosexuality human behavior? Heaven created man and woman. What was the purpose? To procreate future generations. A man being with a man, or a woman with a woman - it doesn’t take much thought to know whether that’s right or wrong. When minor things are done incorrectly, a person is said to be wrong. When major things are done incorrectly, it’s a case of people no longer having the moral code of human beings, and then they are unworthy of being human.

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) strongly disagrees with that view, because it is the type of thing that makes people feel bad for characteristics that they have, but cannot change.

Also, it is very hard to pass any kind of law that forces people not to be racist/discriminatory, because there is always the lingering question: what if they are right about a particular point?

Because clearly everyone has innate characteristics that make them better suited for certain activities than others, we when we select candidates for a job, we are basically discriminating amongst candidates.

Also any such law can have the opposite effect, acting as a justification for further hate.

You and I dislike certain personality traits without any logical reason.

Democracy dislikes dictators, and it is not necessarily rational.

##### Falun Gong on races

[Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) clearly classifies races as a metaphysical concept e.g. on [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990502L.html](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19990502L.html):

> Strictly speaking, Indians, Egyptians, Persians, the yellow race, the white race, and the black race are the six major races of the present Earth. All the other ones are mixed races.

Mixed race people seem to have some metaphysical defect/peculiarity, [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/1997L.html](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/1997L.html):

___
Question: What did you say last time that a person of mixed race has lost?

Teacher: He has lost the body that comes from the top down through to here. Let me put it this way: People of the yellow race have people of the yellow race up there, and people of the white race have people of the white race up there. He’s lost this thread.
___

but they can still go to Heaven:

> Question: Can a person of mixed race succeed in cultivation?
>
> Teacher: Whether someone can cultivate and whether he can succeed in cultivation are all up to the person himself. If a person of mixed race can persist in cultivation, he can reach Consummation just the same. When he succeeds in cultivation his Primordial Spirit will return to wherever he came from.

#### Falun Gong believers are less likely to take necessary medication (法轮功信徒不太可能服用必要的药物)

Based on what [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) saw and heard, he does believe, without any clear statistical evidence, that it is very likely that it hs happened to in many cases that some Falun Gong believers refused to take modern medications and died of diseases that could be otherwise cured.

But consider the following:

* what matters are statistics. Maybe FLG people live longer than non FLG in average. But we will never have statistics because of censorship: https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27529/have-many-falun-gong-practitioners-forgone-medical-treatment-and-died-of-treatab
* maybe people should be [allowed to choose how they want to die](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_legislation), and not to take medication if they don’t want to

  As the [Parks and Recreation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation) caricaturally liberal character [Ron Swanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson) puts it [about the United States](https://youtu.be/_UlNnETAZeI?t=48):

  > The whole point of this country is if you wanna eat garbage, balloon up to six hundred pounds and die of a heart attack at forty three, you can! You are free to do so. To me that’s beautiful.

  [https://youtu.be/kIpaDW3RwtY?t=244 one random thing ex-KGB spy undercover in the USA Jack Barsky mentioned in this BuzzFeed Multiplayer interview stuck to his mind: "The one thing that you have here, that I believe cannot be found anywhere else in the world is called Freedom, with a capital F". If people want to die in a certain way, or believe that some bullshit will cure them, they should be allowed. Natural selection will take care of the rest.](#freedom-with-a-capital-f) also comes to mind.
* maybe the number of people killed during persecution vastly outnumbers those who died because they would not take medication
* several [religions](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), including [Christianity (基督教)](#christianity-(基督教)) have miraculous cure claims. My impression is that claims were mostly notable in the old times apparently, likely because people noticed that Christians were still dying of all kinds of diseases like everyone else, no matter how devout!
* maybe the main reason why communists banned Falun Gong is the political threat it posed, but that a ban was unjustified given the situation. Christian crosses are being taken down as of 2016, have they stopped taking their medications as well? See also [Rule of law (法治)](#rule-of-law-(法治)).
* maybe many of those people would also have died soon even if they had taken medication
* maybe not all Falun Gong believers thought that it was wise to stop taking medication. But their religion was banned anyway. Who can agree and follow all the innumerable prescriptions of any religious or legal system? See also: [Someone from movement X did something bad, therefore the movement should be banned (X运动中的某个人做了坏事，因此该运动应该被禁止)](#someone-from-movement-x-did-something-bad,-therefore-the-movement-should-be-banned-(x运动中的某个人做了坏事，因此该运动应该被禁止)).
* all the following also reduce people’s lifespan:

  * riding motorcycles vs. cars/buses
  * smoking
  * moving to a poor country to do charity there
  * eating fast food

  Forbidding them also has huge humanitarian costs (more expensive vehicles, creation of a black market, ...). So why not forbid them as well?

Especially In the beginning, Falun Gong did put a lot of emphasis on its health benefits, just [like all the other contemporaneous Qi Gong practices](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)), and it is likely that especially many in the first generation of believers do believe it more than others.

For example, the main initial public announcement of Falun Gong was at a [Health Exposition in Beijing](#history-of-falun-gong-法轮功历史).

In [Canonical Falun Gong texts (法轮功的经典著作)](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) itself, this is not super explicit and emphasised as far as Ciro can see. Zhuan Falun [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_74.htm](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/zfl_74.htm) has a chapter entitled "On the Issue of Healing Illnesses", that contains:

>     Let us talk about the most common illnesses, like tumors, infections or osteoproliferation etc., found in the human body. In another space, a very deep space, there lies an evil intelligent entity.

and the general very beaty-around-the-bush suggestion that if you do master Falun Gong fully, you will be healthy. But with the usual disclaimer that "you have to become a master", and since "there are no graduates", no one is ever a master for sure, and as usual "you don’t get the promised goodies", as as mentioned at: [Orange Papers (橙色文件)](#orange-papers-(橙色文件)).

https://www.falundafa.org/book/eng/mgjf.htm contains some more direct quotes that suggest that you can take medicine, but you have to try and bear the pain first, and if you can’t, it’s a sign that you haven’t practiced Falun Gong well enough:

> So when you take medicine now you’re killing this sickness or the virus at the surface. Medicine can truly kill viruses at the surface. Yet a practitioner’s gong[7] is automatically destroying viruses and karma. But as soon as medicine kills the surface virus that has seeped over from other dimensions, the virus—karma—over on the other side will know, since everything is alive, and it will stop coming over. Then you feel that you’ve recovered because you took the medicine. But let me tell you that it nonetheless accumulates over there. Life after life human beings are accumulating this stuff. When the accumulation reaches a certain extent, the person becomes incurable and when he dies he’s totally destroyed. He loses his life—forever loses his life. That’s how horrifying it is. So here I’ve explained to you the relationship. It’s not that people aren’t allowed to take medicine. When an everyday person gets sick he definitely needs medical treatment.
>
> But how do we cultivators deal with it? Aren’t we purifying your body? Like the annual rings of a tree, there is karma at the very core, and at every layer, life after life, of your body. When you practice cultivation, I keep pushing this karma outward from the center; I push, and push, and push, and push until I completely push the karma out for you. And not all of this can go through the surface of our bodies. You wouldn’t be able to bear it if all of it were to go through the surface of your body. Only a portion of it comes out through the surface. But you still feel that you’re suddenly getting sick, you find it terribly uncomfortable and painful, can’t bear it, regard yourself as an everyday person, and go take medicine. Then you can go ahead and take medicine, as we’ve never said that everyday people can’t take medicine. We only say that your enlightenment quality isn’t up to par and that you didn’t pass this test well.

Ciro does however believe that newer generations believe in this much less, notably because the first believer generation is all basically old or dead, and soon will be entirely dead. This might also have been de-emphasised to reduce the bullshit aspects and help the international spread of Falun Gong. Not even Falun Gong believers are that blind. And this perfectly mimics the beginning of Christianism, where the first generations gave much more emphasis to miraculous cures.

[Me and Li by Ben Hurley (2017)](#me-and-li-by-ben-hurley-(2017)) has an anecdote on this, which Ciro feels sounds believable:

> I think it was Lynn’s* death that finally made me realise it was time to leave. I’d seen the writing on the wall about a year prior when I saw her at a yearly "Fa conference" for believers of Falun Gong, otherwise known as Falun Dafa, to exchange experiences and grow spiritually together. An executive assistant at a Queensland valuation firm, I’d gotten to know her over the years in various events as a warm and level-headed lady who had time for everyone. But I’d noticed she had developed a bulge on the side of her head and I was trying not to look at it when I talked to her. I saw, or at least I believed I saw, some pain in her smile. She was probably questioning herself over and over again what "attachments" she hadn’t let go of that were causing this sickness to spread through her body and endanger her life. I wanted to tell her to just go to a hospital, although I wasn’t at this stage resolute enough in my gradual return to logic. Another part of me feared that by looking at it I was acknowledging it — something you don’t do with illnesses in Falun Gong because Master Li Hongzhi teaches that his pupils don’t get illnesses. He can cure you but only if you don’t have any loopholes in your belief in him and his teachings. Some people with solid beliefs can actually die due to others around them having flaws in their thinking, Li says. Just thinking the wrong way is perilous when you’re a Falun Gong practitioner.
>
> I later heard through the grapevine of Lynn’s death. The cancer went into her brain and she passed away in extreme pain, probably believing to the end that it was her fault she was in this awful predicament. In a way, I guess it was.

and more interesting anecdotes follow, see source.

And Ciro has felt this first hand with his [mother-in-law](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆)). Whenever she has a health worry, first she tries to hide it. But then she casually mentions it without much thought because she speaks all the time the poor lady, may she be blessed. And then, when Ciro says: OK, let’s try and treat it, even for trivial things that might have simple treatments, she immediately smiles a compassionate smile of "I’m a Falun Gong believer, I don’t need that". This makes Ciro really mad. He tries to not show it, because he thinks people should be able to choose how they die. But Li promises the powers of [remote, cross dimensional and past/future vision](#flg-cross-dimensional-vision) to some believers, and yet, blinds some of them to the obvious fact that they are aging, and, slowly but surely, their own bodies are starting to fail, like everyone else’s will at one point.

It is also interesting to note how the Chinese government itself supported Falun Gong and [other Qi Gong practices](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)) for their health benefits, which is why they grew so large in the first place. [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) was even [awarded prizes and recognized as a Qi Gong master by state backed organizations in 1992 and 1993](#history-of-falun-gong-法轮功历史). And the CCP still has a tendency to support certain non-scientific traditional practices: [Support for non-scientific traditional practices (支持非科学的传统做法)](#support-for-non-scientific-traditional-practices-(支持非科学的传统做法)).

If people want to die in a certain way, or believe that some bullshit will cure them, they should be allowed. Natural selection will take care of the rest.**

##### Falun Gong's view of epidemics (法轮功的流行病观)

[Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) has said in [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) things that lead certain believers (including e.g. [Ciro’s mother in law](#ciro-santilli's-wife-(三西猴的老婆))) to believe that because they are good Falun Gong believers, that they are more safe from disease from evil people.

For example, in the 2003 "Fa conference" at the time of [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome) he [said](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/20030420L.html):

> You must have seen the epidemic that’s come along in China now, right? Hasn’t a huge epidemic arrived? To put it in human terms, it’s Heaven punishing people. What it’s targeting, we Dafa disciples know full well: it’s targeting those who don’t deserve to be saved, who are impossible to save while Dafa disciples clarify the truth, and who aren’t useful to the evil rotten spirits. This is the first round of cleansing. Heaven is punishing the evil, yet China is still lying to cover up the number of deaths, and I’ll tell you, it’s huge, and it hasn’t peaked yet.

Such beliefs have of course carried over directly to [COVID-19](#censorship-of-the-2019-corona-virus-(2019冠状病毒病早期迹象审查)). Of course, epidemics make the moral question much more difficult, because not taking care of yourself means you can kill others besides yourself.

An amazing quote from [https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/20/183715.html](https://en.minghui.org/html/articles/2020/3/20/183715.html):

> Stay Rational
>
> Pandemics and plagues are part of a divine plan and inevitable in the course of history.

Stay rational. Believe in God ;-)

Epidemics are also likely moments where religious grow due to more people being more desperate and looking for solace that cannot be found in this shitty world.

It is indeed tempting to believe that the virus magically kills only the Evil. What reality could be so fucked up where the innocent suffocate to their death? And yet, here we are.

#### Falun Gong liturgical calendar (法轮功教会年历)

Exactly like [other religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liturgical_year), Falun Gong has some important dates that are celebrated to keep believers engaged. Those are:

* May 13th: [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))'s claimed birthday, although the Chinese government and some scholars disagree with that date, which suspicioiusly seems to coincide with the Buddha’s birthdate

  Also known as "Dafa Day".

  The international Falun Gong conference, usually called just "Fa Conference" (法会), also happens around that date in New York, the state where Li Hongzhi lives in [Dragon Springs (龙泉, Falun Gong's headquarters in New York State)](#dragon-springs-(龙泉,-falun-gong's-headquarters-in-new-york-state)) for the same reason, e.g. in 2019 it was on May 17 https://www.ntd.com/over-10000-share-stories-of-self-improvement-at-falun-dafa-conference_331440.html

  There are other more local Fa conferences held throughout the year however also.

#### Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/李洪志

Li Hongzhi is the creator of [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)): [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi).

Falun Gong people call him "master" (师父), which is a common traditional term used to respectfully address experienced teachers in a disciple (弟子)/teacher relation, e.g. Kung Fu or other crafts.

However they also believe that he has many many God-like powers and is comparable figures such as Jesus and Buddha himself.

Notably they believe that he has superpowers, and that everything that he says is the absolute truth of the universe, see also: [Is Falun Gong a religion? 法轮功是一个宗教吗？](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？).

The term "master" is also used for example in the fictional film The Master (2012), which is likely inspired in [Scientology](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？).

[Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) however prefers to call him [prophet](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？), since he feels LHZ is indistinguishable from [any other religion](#is-falun-gong-a-religion?-法轮功是一个宗教吗？). Guru/[cult leader](#is-falun-gong-a-cult?-(法轮功是邪教吗？)) could also apply.

It’s funny that even though Falun Gong only came up recently in the 80’s, we still know relatively little about Li. One is kind of reminded of Jesus! See also [Li Hongzhi's family (李洪志的家庭)](#li-hongzhi's-family-(李洪志的家庭)) and [Li Hongzhi's hagiography (李洪志的圣徒传记)](#li-hongzhi's-hagiography-(李洪志的圣徒传记)).

One should note however that this is partly by design: at some point in the 90’s, Li relatively stepped away from public view. This is because once you reach a critical mass of followers, it is better to let them to the preaching for you, while you hide your obvious human defects in a corner. See also comments at [Vissarion](#vissarion).

##### Falun Gong is dangerous because Li Hongzhi has too much power over followers (法轮功是危险的，因为李洪志对追随者的权力太大)

Ciro agrees that there is danger in every religion, and especially new religions.

However the same point can be made about political parties and in particular the CCP and its chairman.

Couldn’t a charismatic leader chairman gain more and more power (like Xi seems to be doing), and eventually start a war and kill millions? Or just kill some minority who is not happy about the situation.

Similarly, any charismatic leader of a pro-democracy movement could become the leader of a terrorist organization.

If you ever want democracy, you will have to learn to accept the beliefs of others, and only punish them when they actually break a law.

Finally, LHZ was born in 1951, so he will die in 20 years, unless FLG is true and a miracle happens, and then this argument will become invalid.

From what Ciro hears, LHZ has always maintained that he is the only source of truth on FLG (see also "The Guru is always right"), and therefore, so his death will very likely remove any danger once and for all.

Furthermore, it also seems to Ciro that FLG is clearly anti-violence and self-harm, so Ciro wonder how many would follow a contradictory order such as killing or suicide? We have had no hint of any incitation to violence so far.

It is also interesting to look into the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown case. When the suicide order came, most people wanted out! Without physically controlling the followers, I don’t think you can make them do much.

##### Li Hongzhi's hagiography (李洪志的圣徒传记)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi mentions that there are two versions of the biography:

* An unofficial biography appeared in the first of Li’s major publications, [Zhongguo Falun Gong](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)), supposedly authored by journalist Zhu Huiguang (朱慧光).

  The full text appears to be at available at: http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130#<mark># (God bless [Taiwanese](#taiwan-(republic-of-china,-台湾,-中華民國)) piracy, [archive](++https://web.archive.org/web/20200805093333/http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=130</mark>##++))

  [The Life and times of Li Hongzhi by Benjamin Penny (2003)](#the-life-and-times-of-li-hongzhi-by-benjamin-penny-(2003)) gives the full title of the section + a translation (originally in pinyin, but why?!?! :-)):

  > 法輪旋轉新天地-記李洪志先生和他創立的法輪功\
  > "The wheel of the law revolves the new cosmos - on Li Hongzhi and the Falun Gong he founded".
* A second, official spiritual biography appeared in early editions of [Falun Gong’s primary text, Zhuan Falun](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)).

  It is shorter than the first, and is marked as authored by the "Falun Dafa Research Society’s President" (法轮功研究会会长).

  The Wiki quotes [The Religion of Falun Gong by Benjamin Penny (2012)](#the-religion-of-falun-gong-by-benjamin-penny-(2012)).

  Penny says that it was removed in 1999 (presumably to remove some more glaring magical bullshit help with internationalization).

  A possible Chinese copy might be found at: http://qingqing.freebbs.tw/viewthread.php?tid=165### inside a 1994 version of Zhuan Falun.

  The section is entitled "中国法轮功创始人、法轮功研究会会长 李洪志先生小传", so literally tranlated as a "profile" (小传) rather than a full biography. The index marks it as 附 (addendum), and it comes at the end of the book.

##### What will happen to Falun Gong when Li Honzhi dies? (李洪志死后，法轮功会怎样？)

https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-to-Li-Hongzhi-the-founder-of-Falun-Gong-when-he-is-not-in-this-world-anymore/answer/Ciro-Santilli

##### Let's make a mini series about Li Hongzhi's life (让我们制作一个关于李洪志生平的迷你系列)

Ciro can’t help but to imagine how Falun Gong came about in detail.

Someone should write a ["The Last Temptation of Christ"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(novel)).

This deserves an American miniseries like Chernobyl.

It would manage to piss off both FLG and the CCP, which would be amazing. It is a shame that it is so difficult to find good historical information between the infinite barrages of CCP and FLG propaganda.

It could show how:

* Li was an ordinary dude who could liked to play the trumpet, which partially explains his focus on [Shen Yun](#falun-gong-media-(法轮功媒体)) and Falun Gong musical street parades
* Li first heard about Qi Gong, and went to practice it under some dude. Then how he saw other people were so into it, and decided to take this opportunity to make a career out of it during the 80’s
* how he met his wife and had a daughter
* how he started to notice how people were feeling things during the exercise classes, and started suggesting more and more metaphysics to these first disciples
* Li could also have some metaphysical moment, like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW20LbwAmng but at the same time, he must tell his followers some lies which he does not believe
* how followers started telling others things and "experience sharing" where the cycle of belief stats to take off
* a clear demonstration of how "A group of early adopters in Changchun became disenchanted after Li forbade his followers from charging fees for the practice at the end of 1994" showing dissent within the cult
* and finally, the immigration and crackdown, and how he put his fingers on those things, and the creation of media, this could be the last episode

Episodes could be split along:

* Episode 1: pre Qi Gong, shows Childhood, workplaces, early motivations. Ends with first contact with a Qi Gong lesson
* Episode 2: early Falun Gong. Opens an academy. Starts without metaphysics, but grows into it. Show him knowingly lying, but also seething magic things. The first followers, and top lieutenants. Makes some management mistake, but gets away with it. Could end in a metaphysical scene, or 13 May 1992 initial public lesson. Maybe a scene of Li’s visit to [Thailand (泰国)](#thailand-(泰国)) in 1983 (photo from CCP media found on Google).
* Episode 3: later Falun Gong in China. It grows, show in Chinese news. Power struggles, problems with early lieutenants, and new lieutenants come up. Many people practice on streets. Battle against [Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)). Near 1996, something tips Li off to the fact that the CCP is going to crack down on them, and so he announces that he will be spreading abroad full time. Check out if this was before or after the first Anti FLG newspaper article in 1996-06-17.
* Episode 4: preaching outside of China and emigration. American permanent residence in 1998. Watches crackdown on television. International Falun Gong media. Show him at Falun Gong New York ["Dragon Springs"](#dragon-springs-(龙泉,-falun-gong's-headquarters-in-new-york-state)) complex

Or maybe, never mind that boring post 1992 stuff which is already highly public, instead we could focus only on the more interesting pre-1992 events, and finish in 1992.

So per-early FLG up to 1992, with childhood flashbacks.

The tone should of course be a mixture of:

* personal insight of the master
* the love of a follower
* external view of their shortcomings

Parts of the series could be filmed in [Taiwan (Republic of China, 台湾, 中華民國)](#taiwan-(republic-of-china,-台湾,-中華民國)) maybe?

And Li Jinping, not to be confused with [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)), is an evil Qi Gong who uses his powers to rule over his kingdom ruthlessly, ridding it of non-believers.

##### Li Hongzhi's family (李洪志的家庭)

Jesus appeared to value chastity. He was born from a virgin. No sex around him at all.

Buddha gave it up after his enlightenment.

But Li doesn’t need that. He’s a God, right, he can both be an Enlightened God part time and still have a normal family part time.

Once thing Ciro approves about Li’s approach to his family is that he seems to have stated (TODO source) that none of them are Gods like him.

It is however very likely that some of his close family members will take up an even greater importance in the inner circle of power once Li dies: [What will happen to Falun Gong when Li Honzhi dies?

    * Notably, Li Ping’s alleged husband Sun Senlun (Natawut Smittipong, 孙森伦) is a Chinese-Thai, and allegedly wrote an account of Li Hongzhi’s family in the 1980’s: [Diaries of being in Thailand with Li Hongzhi's family (我与李洪志一家在泰国的日子——法轮功教主妹夫的自述)](#diaries-of-being-in-thailand-with-li-hongzhi's-family-(我与李洪志一家在泰国的日子——法轮功教主妹夫的自述))

      The book also claims that they had two children Sun Baoyuan (孙宝圆) and Sun Baoman (孙宝满), which Li later managed to rename Li Baoyuan (李宝圆) and Li Baoman (李宝满).

      [Shen Yun Performing Arts (神韵艺术团, Falun Gong media)](#shen-yun-performing-arts-(神韵艺术团,-falun-gong-media)) had dancers called with those exact same Chinese character names between 2009 and 2020, so it is very likely that it is them:

### Qigong fever (气功热 , 1980's)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qigong_fever

AKA Qigong Boom.

* https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/26268612 特异功能、法功灭火、铝锅传功……80年代的气功热究竟有多疯狂？ (How crazy was the Qi Gong boom after all?) on [Zhihu (知乎, censored Quora clone, 审查 Quora 克隆)](#zhihu-(知乎,-censored-quora-clone,-审查-quora-克隆))

#### Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhong_Gong
* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中华养生益智功

A very similar religion to [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)), that also emerged during the [Qigong fever (气功热 , 1980's)](#qigong-fever-(气功热-,-1980's)) of the '80s and '90s.

Zhong Gong was the second most sucessful Qigong Boom religion after Falun Gong.

The similarity of their imagery as seen from propaganda videos is striking. To [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)), this makes Zhong Gong a perfect example of why [FLG metaphysics is bullshit](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong?-(三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)): it is obvious that both Zhong Gong and Falun Gong and many others were just random dudes who took advantage of the Qigong fever to create their religions.

Their prophet is [Zhang Hongbao (张宏堡)](#zhang-hongbao-(张宏堡)).

Interestingly, like [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) who is from [Jilin (吉林)](#jilin-(吉林)), Hongbao is also from the Northeast of China ([Heilongjian Province (黑龙江省)](#heilongjian-province-(黑龙江省))), there must be a reason why those Qi Gong movements come from that region.

Unlike Falun Gong however, Zhong Gong failed to branch the franchise out of China, and basically died out. Hongbao also died in a car crash in 2006 which didn’t help. Li Hongzhi however played smarter, and started branching abroad full force in 1996, he likely predicted that the crackdown was inevitale.

Wikipedia says it reached 34 million followers in China.

Hongbao also has a more spicy history it seems, with sexual allegations and open political goals [unlike Li Hongzhi, who hid his goals better](#people-from-movement-x-are-only-in-it-for-political-power-(x运动的人只是为了政治权力)). Well played, Li, well played.

[Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) maintains in [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) that Falun Gong is of course extremely different from all of those other extremely similar Qi Gong religions. Zhong Gong is likely not mentioned by name, but it is also likely one of the main targets. E.g. in 1998 [canon](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) [https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980329L.html](https://falundafa.org/eng/eng/lectures/19980329L.html):

> Dafa can’t be obtained lightly. For example, the diversity of cults and the number of false qigongs are large these days, and they lead people astray. Many people who are capable of cultivating get sucked into them, and some of them engage in suicide - it’s a mess.

this is a perfect example of [Uncanny valley (恐怖谷理论)](#uncanny-valley-(恐怖谷理论)).

Zhong Gong videos:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX72zfEP_zs googd Zhong Gong playlist
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYH8Y_1UmrY&t=1445 Zhong Gong people "experience sharing". It truly is exactly like Falun Gong.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2GxSJK9c-A this appears to be positive mainstream media coverage of Zhong Gong
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ziluy_AlEI video of Hongbao giving a lecture dated 1994 and commented "Qiling kylin Tianhua culture"
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQKCtPSfdR4 video dated January 21st, 2007 of Monks praying after his death
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvJSzeY7Chw contains a bunch of what appear to be extremely low quality Zhong Gong propaganda videos. It is very similar to Falun Gong’s of course.

The embassy spokesman says Chinese officials have ample evidence of sect leader Zhang Hongbao’s involvement in crimes such as rape and murder.

Prophet of [Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)), just like [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) is the prophet of [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)).

#### Xiang Gong (香功, 中国芳香智悟气功, Qigong religion)

This was possibly the third most popular Qi Gong of the [Qigong fever (气功热 , 1980's)](#qigong-fever-(气功热-,-1980's)) after [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)) and [Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)). It is mentioned for example at [the-falungong-phenomenon-by-hu-ping-2003](#the-falungong-phenomenon-by-hu-ping-2003).

Literal translation:

* Fragrant Gong
* China Fragrang Wisdom Comprehension Gong

It is however so obscure that there isn’t even a wikipedia page for it anymore!

The prophet’s name was Tian Ruisheng (田瑞生). He’s the old due at: https://www.sohu.com/a/270132785_100279655 with little badges on his coat. He can be seen lecturing for example at: https://youtu.be/ItAUwGWSXuI?t=167

Some mentions in English:

* https://taijiclub.live/2020/05/09/xiang-gong-the-fragrant-mind-awakening-qigong/ Xiang Gong: The Fragrant Mind Awakening Qigong (2020) Interesting quote:

  >     Basically, the origin of this qigong comes from Master Tian Ruisheng. Master Tian Ruisheng was taught this as a ill young boy by a traveling buddhist monk. He was told to practice it every day and not reveal it until 50 years later. He diligently practiced and eventually taught it after 50 years. It quickly became a popular qigong in China.

  This is exactly the type of "Creation Story" that [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) invented. Notably, it is not something he just made up to take advantage of the obvious [Qigong fever (气功热 , 1980's)](#qigong-fever-(气功热-,-1980's)). No, it is something that he developped his entire life, and only started teaching at that point due to a coincidence!

  This is notably highlighted in [Diaries of being in Thailand with Li Hongzhi's family (我与李洪志一家在泰国的日子——法轮功教主妹夫的自述)](#diaries-of-being-in-thailand-with-li-hongzhi's-family-(我与李洪志一家在泰国的日子——法轮功教主妹夫的自述)). Li’s sister just casualy never mentioned to her husband that her brother had been having mystical training for several years, until he finally announced it in the early days of [Falun Gong (法轮功, Qigong new religion/cult)](#falun-gong-(法轮功,-qigong-new-religion/cult)).

  In Tian’s case however, he is truly really old. This is possibly a major reason why he didn’t get as big as Falun Gong. It is terribly discriminatory, but who wants to look at an old ugly dude? Especially when he’s likely teaching stuff that is supposed to cure diseases. [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet)) and 
* https://www.beliefnet.com/news/2000/05/chinese-crackdown-goes-beyond-falun-gong.aspx Chinese Crackdown Goes Beyond Falun Gong (2000) mentions [Zhong Gong (中功, 中华养生益智功, Qigong religion)](#zhong-gong-(中功,-中华养生益智功,-qigong-religion)) and [Xiang Gong (香功, 中国芳香智悟气功, Qigong religion)](#xiang-gong-(香功,-中国芳香智悟气功,-qigong-religion)). Says it is from AP News, but I can’t find the original. But the language does look "AP-like".

  > China’s entirely state-run media and the government have trumpeted the crackdown on Falun Gong. Thousands of practitioners have been detained since it was outlawed in July in the campaign against what the government says is an evil cult.
  >
  > But authorities refuse to talk about the clampdown on other qi gong organizations, and state media have all but ignored it. So far the campaign has affected at least five groups, practitioners, government sources and human rights organizations say.

  The other groups, even smaller, are mentioned in the article next:

  This reminded [Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) of a Qigong/Taichi course he went to for a few months when he was a young teenager in Santos, Brazil, attended almost exclusively by older ladies.

  Some people, even outside China, like "mystic stuff", and may start a mystic stuff practice, more or less affiliated to a certain current of mysticism.

  Especially since people know nothing about any of the currents, partly due to the language barrier, it often becomes a larger more dilluted current os mysticisms.

  The same likely applied to that course Ciro attended, but at the time he was clueless and didn’t really classify his teacher’s influences.

  Ciro must say however, that some of the exercises were good, and have become a permanent part of Ciro’s [Cirodance](https://cirosantilli.com/cirodance).

  The only thing Ciro rejects completely is the metaphysical bullshit: [Does Ciro Santilli believe in or practice Falun Gong? (三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)](#does-ciro-santilli-believe-in-or-practice-falun-gong?-(三西猴信仰或者练法轮功吗？)).

  Though if something has a lot of metaphysical bullshit, it makes it hard for Ciro to practice it without thinking about the metaphysics.

  Maria speaks perfect Portuguese, and given the name Lee she must be a second or later generation immigrant. She’s likely from Sao Paulo. Here’s a video of her in the 70’s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaPlwdb5iIw when she was likely in her late 30’s, already as a Qigong teacher.

  Mystical movements like that likely had a decent following in Brazil, especially in the 70’s linked to the [Hippies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie) ([嬉皮士](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/嬉皮士)). Ciro’s mother mentioned some related stories of her friends.

The commies are not a fan. But as someone once told me: the commies are not a fan of a bunch of things!

As mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_China there are only a few state approved churches under total CCP control, and the others are forbidden. For example one of them is called the [Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Patriotic_Catholic_Association)! God and CCP on the same sentence. [Pope Pius XII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XII) excommunicated people from that organization who were appointing new Bishops!

* https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中華人民共和國與梵蒂岡關係

> In January 2018, the Church was close to negotiating a deal with China that allows China to have more control over the underground churches and allows the Vatican to have more control over the appointment of bishops. While this did not amount to the establishment of formal diplomatic ties, this was seen as a huge step towards formal recognition.[21] However, Joseph Zen Ze-kiun regarded the warming of diplomatic relationships as selling out the Catholic Church in China, as the process involves the resignation of several bishops of the underground church.

Even with such tiny community, the [Chinese "Communist" Party (CCP, 中国共产党, 1949-, Cult of Mao/Xi, 毛习邪教, 10.000 year Reich)](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich)) is still trying to pretende they never existed.

## Gay rights (LGBT权利)

Yes, gay people are also [discriminated to different degrees in Western countries](#the-ccp-exaggerates-the-threat-of-the-west-to-keep-in-power-(中共夸大了西方要继续掌权的威胁)), and even legally prohibited notably in the Islamic world.

But [like all minorities](#most-chinese-people-don't-care-about-the-minorities-(大多数中国人不关心少数民族)), they are generally more fucked in [dictatorships](#why-does-ciro-santilli-say-that-china-is-a-dictatorship?-(中国不是独裁！)), since they can be easily crushed by majorities.

Therefore, all gay people must be against the CCP.

### Everyone can feel that a profound change is underway by Li Guangman (2021, 李光满《每个人都能感受到，一场深刻的变革正在进行！》)

Political essay reposted by major [Chinese government media (中国政府媒体)](#chinese-government-media-(中国政府媒体)):

* [Xinhua News Agency (新华通讯社, 新华社, CCP media)](#xinhua-news-agency-(新华通讯社,-新华社,-ccp-media)): http://xinhuanet.com/politics/2021-08/29/c_1127807097.htm

The hole thing is about exerting greater state control on everything, a trend that has been observed as of August 2021, notably on the media.

The damning [Gay rights (LGBT权利)](#gay-rights-(lgbt权利)) sentence appears to be:

> 彻底杜绝社会性格中的娘炮和小鲜肉现象，真正让娱乐圈、文艺圈、影视圈风正、气正

which translates as:

> Completely put an end to the phenomenon of sissies and teen idols in the social character, and truly make the entertainment, art, and film and television circles upright and upright.

the slang keywords being:

* 娘炮: sissy
* 小鲜肉: teen idols (lit. little fresh meat)

The author Li Guangman (李光满) was not notable enough yet to have a Wikipedia page, not even [Baidu Baike (百度百科, Chinese censored Wikipedia clone)](#baidu-baike-(百度百科,-chinese-censored-wikipedia-clone)), so [Zhihu (知乎, censored Quora clone, 审查 Quora 克隆)](#zhihu-(知乎,-censored-quora-clone,-审查-quora-克隆)) for now: https://www.zhihu.com/question/60685910

It should be noted that the homophobia is just a tiny fraction of the essay, which is much more generally about the state taking more control over everything, including culture, and sparking fears of a second [Cultural Revolution (文化大革命, 1966-1976)](#cultural-revolution-(文化大革命,-1966-1976)).

### 996.ICU (2019)

https://github.com/996icu/996.ICU

Repository published in 2019-04 protesting against excessive work hours by Chinese programmers.

At some point it moved its README to English.

This was not directly censored to our knowledge, but the fact that it was published on GitHub rather than Chinese social media highlights the obvious fact that Chinese programmers were weary of doing it under CCP controlled media which they do not trust.

The project name refers to:

* "996": work from 9AM to 9PM 6 days a week. This is part of a wider tendency of Chinese netizens to use [Internet number slang (网络数字语言)](#internet-number-slang-(网络数字语言))
* "ICU": [Intensive Care Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit)

Went to Harvard from 2010 to 2014 under pseudonym, apparently Xiao Muzi (小木子).

https://www.businessinsider.com/xi-mingze-harvard-article-goes-viral-2012-11 mentions:

> The Chinese elite is no doubt keen to avoid questions about how exactly Xi Jinping can afford his daughters fees. Officially, his salary is less than $13,000 a year, and Xi’s circle has been remarkably cagey about reports of his family’s true wealth before.

plus 24-hour bodyguards. [Panama papers (巴拿马文件, 2016)](#panama-papers-(巴拿马文件,-2016)) comes to mind.

##### Xi Jinping nicknames (习近平昵称)

* 習包子: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29230 says:

  > Xi Jinping got his nickname as "Xi baozi 習包子" ("[steamed stuffed bun Xi](#chinese-buns-包子-(bao1-zi))") due to the much publicized visit he made to the famous Qìngfēng bāozi pù 庆丰包子铺 ("Qingfeng baozi shop") in Beijing. During and after his visit to the shop, media swarmed over the place and were eager to portray an image of Xi as being down to earth and close to the people. Those who dislike Xi use this nickname sarcastically against him for being a hick and for hypocritically "putting on a show" (zuòxiù 作秀).

  See also: [Chinese buns 包子 (bao1 zi)](#chinese-buns-包子-(bao1-zi)).
* 大撒币: https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29230 says:

  > It can be translated as "big spender," a play on the literal translation of the words sā bì 撒币 "throw money" and "stupid cunt" (shǎ bī 傻逼). The nickname takes aim at the economic aid Xi has promised to foreign countries; the moniker is so widely used on Chinese social media that the censors' repressive measures only draw more attention to it, and to the criticism embedded within it.

###### Xi Dada (习大大, 2015)

Benevolent [personification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification) of [Xi Jinping (习近平, 2012-∞, Heil卐!)](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!)). Part of the [CCP cult (中共邪教)](#ccp-cult-(中共邪教)).

##### Xi Jinping looks like Winnie-the-Pooh (习近平长得像小熊维尼, 2017)

Got censored due to comparisons between Xi Jinping and Winnie in 2017: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh#Censorship_in_China

Thailand has their own version: [Side-by-side comparison between [Thai King Vajiralongkorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajiralongkorn) and [Hamtaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamtaro). This is the Thai version of [](#!winnie-the-pooh). It [has been used by protesters](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japanese-cartoon-Hamtaro-used-by-Thai-protesters-to-mock-government) as part of the [2020 Thai protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Thai_protests). Left [photo source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Thai_protests).](#thai-king-hamtaro).

In [Xi Dada (习大大, 2015)](#xi-dada-(习大大,-2015)) we see that a [People's Daily (人民日报, CCP media)](#people's-daily-(人民日报,-ccp-media)) video actually interviews someone who mentions that, so the meme has had a positive connotation at least some point in the past.

Related:

* 2021-06-07: Triple A game [Cyberpunk 2077](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077) developer used a "Winnie the Pooh" label internally to mark game content that needed to be censored for the Chinese release as shown by a source code leak
  * More precisely, the constant was named `Censor_WinnieThePooh`, with a comment `// China`.

#### Xi Jinping Thought (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想, 2017)

Added to the Constitution in preparation for [eternal rule](#xi-jinping-abolishes-term-limits-(习近平取消国家主席任期限制,-2018-03)).

[Xi Jinping (习近平, 2012-∞, Heil卐!)](#xi-jinping-(习近平,-2012-∞,-heil卐!))'s [Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (Little Red Book, 毛主席语录, 1976)](#quotations-from-chairman-mao-tse-tung-(little-red-book,-毛主席语录,-1976)). But since it is the 21st century, there’s an app for it instead called "Study (for a) Strong Country" (学习强国) designed by [Alibaba (阿里巴巴, Chinese Amazon clone)](#alibaba-(阿里巴巴,-chinese-amazon-clone)):

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuexi_Qiangguo

Contains [devotional](#ccp-cult-(中共邪教)) videos, not text: http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/xjpsxkj/1.html

Notably, it consists of 14 chapters, which are called "talks" (讲), e.g. the first talk (第一讲) etc. This is exactly like [Li Hongzhi (李洪志, LHZ, Falun Gong prophet)](#li-hongzhi-(李洪志,-lhz,-falun-gong-prophet))'s [Zhuan Falun](#canonical-falun-gong-texts-(法轮功的经典著作)) (and likely like other ancient Chinese religious texts).

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuexi_Qiangguo

* https://www.xuexi.cn/

App made by [Alibaba (阿里巴巴, Chinese Amazon clone)](#alibaba-(阿里巴巴,-chinese-amazon-clone)) for the [Chinese "Communist" Party (CCP, 中国共产党, 1949-, Cult of Mao/Xi, 毛习邪教, 10.000 year Reich)](#chinese-"communist"-party-(ccp,-中国共产党,-1949-,-cult-of-mao/xi,-毛习邪教,-10.000-year-reich)) to teach people [Xi Jinping Thought (习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想, 2017)](#xi-jinping-thought-(习近平新时代中国特色社会主义思想,-2017)).

Literally means "study for a strong country".

One of the beautiful things about that name is that is reminds one of the [expression](#i-am-going-to-use-a-bunch-of-chinese-slangs-because-it-makes-me-feel-smart-(我知道网络语言，我很聪明)) "强国人" (strong country person), coined in during the 2014 during the [2014 Hong Kong protests (Umbrella movement, 雨伞运动占领区)](#2014-hong-kong-protests-(umbrella-movement,-雨伞运动占领区)) to refer ironically to Mainland Chines people, due to their exaggerated self-perceived strength and superiority, see also [Wumao 2011 vs little pink 2021](#wumao-2011-vs-little-pink-2021). A homonym "墙国" (wall country) is also known as a reference to the [Great Firewall (GFW, 防火长城)](#great-firewall-(gfw,-防火长城)), [sample usage](https://archive.ph/czYEv).

The app appears to have both content, and also tests to check that you’ve read the bullshit.

At https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/mnulkd/china_is_forcing_chinese_to_use_national/gu05o20/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 a [Reddit](#reddit) user explains:

> Many people are also forced to use the app "强国学习" in order to keep their jobs. Especially government workers. They have to study XiJinPing thought for certain amount of time each week and do exams.

This is confirmed e.g. at: https://www.hf.uio.no/ikos/english/studies/voices-middle-east-asia/voices-from-east-asia/xuexi-qiangguo-%E2%80%93-digitalization-of-chinese-propaga.html

> Within the first four months of Xuexi Qiangguo’s release, it was the most downloaded app in China with over 100 million downloads, surpassing China’s most popular messaging, social media and mobile payment app, [WeChat (微信, Weixin)](#wechat-(微信,-weixin)) and the [Chinese version of TikTok, known as Douyin](#tiktok-(douyin,-抖音)).
>
> To use the app is not exactly voluntary. The Communist Party has issued directives that requires party members to download the app and use it. Many workplaces have done the same and it has been reported that employees are required to send screenshots to document their progress on the app. If they don’t, they are at risk of a pay deduction.
>
> To put it in perspective, over 90 million Chinese are members of the Communist Party, and there are nearly 850 million internet users and almost 690 million smart phone users in China, as of 2019. It is, however, not clear whether the people who have downloaded the app genuinely are interested in learning about Xi Jinping’s political ideology, or if they feel like they must download it to show loyalty to the party.

###### Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo (Fuck学习强国)

[https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo](https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo)

This [GitHub](#github) repository appears to help cheat the Xuexi qiangguo, see also: [GitHub repositories with censored information (政治敏感的GitHub库)](#github-repositories-with-censored-information-(政治敏感的github库)).

The program’s executable file name is actually `./Fuck学习强国`, a thing of beauty.

Several video demos can be found on YouTube:

And there there’s an anti-repo for [Wumao (五毛)](#wumao-(五毛)) who oppose the cheating: https://github.com/boycott-fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Boycott-Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo It had 150 stars as of 2021, as oppoesd to 7500 of the cheating repo.

https://github.com/TechXueXi/TechXueXi appears to be a "non-cheating" assistant? TODO confirm. It is at the very least more politically correct.

The repository was created by Tang Wenzheng (唐文正, [GitHub](#github) alias [Xmader](https://github.com/Xmader)). https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/663593.html According to https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/663593.html form [China Digital Times (CDT, 中国数字时代, USA government media)](#china-digital-times-(cdt,-中国数字时代,-usa-government-media)), he accidentally posted with his real name on an issue once ([Ciro Santilli (三西猴, anti-CCP fanatic, 反中共狂热, stupid cunt, 傻屄, CIA agent, CIA特工, 肏你妈的)](#ciro-santilli-(三西猴,-anti-ccp-fanatic,-反中共狂热,-stupid-cunt,-傻屄,-cia-agent,-cia特工,-肏你妈的)) knows that it is basically impossible not to when juggling multiple accounts simultaneously), and subsequently publicly announced his true identity. Following the name reveal, he did an AMA on [Terminus2049 (端点星计划, 2049bbs)](#terminus2049-(端点星计划,-2049bbs)) [https://2047.name/t/11552](https://2047.name/t/11552), and luckily he is abroad, and does not intend to come back. Wenzheng also created the https://github.com/china-digital-times/china-digital-times.github.io [GitHub](#github) pages mirror of [China Digital Times (CDT, 中国数字时代, USA government media)](#china-digital-times-(cdt,-中国数字时代,-usa-government-media)), further discussed in that section. At https://github.com/fuck-xuexiqiangguo/Fuck-XueXiQiangGuo/issues/578 on 2021-03-03, he announced that he would stop working on the project because his parents weren’t needing the APP anymore, succession wasn’t announced. A few commits followed in the next days, but presumably minimal maintenance and ramp-down.

Wenzheng was also involved in a notable possible copyright dispute with [https://musescore.org/en](https://musescore.org/en), a software that Ciro actually enjoyed, as shown at https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882472815 which was then highlighted at [https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/onro8q/head_of_strategy_of_muse_group_muse_score/](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/onro8q/head_of_strategy_of_muse_group_muse_score/). At https://web.archive.org/web/20210719115639if_/https://github.com/Xmader/musescore-downloader/issues/5#issuecomment-882450335 the developer noted that this could lead to Xmader’s deportation. Some interpreted this as threat, but Ciro feels that it might be true as the developers noted that they withheld action for a while to prevent his deportation.
